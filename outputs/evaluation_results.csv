December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statemen ts of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemabl e

related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the acco mpanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial 
statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on cr iteria

likewise harm our business. 
Our failure to upgrade our technology or netw ork infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated  
system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To mana ge 
the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the tec hnology that supports our business ope rations, as well as our fin ancial

commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction proc essing 
and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with 
respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designi ng 
controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we 
acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and pl anned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be

Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.",147.64435729155565,776.7271995544434

in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, and may in

the future implement other reductions in wo rkforce. Any reduction in workforce or re structuring may yield unintended consequenc es 
and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in wo rkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and

For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining a nd attracting high- quality personnel, 
and continued attrition, future attrition,  or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included i n Part I, 
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Driver and Courier Well-Being 
In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, 
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates.

• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and

How does Uber's strategy for managing growth through technology upgrades relate to their overall business model sustainability?,"Based on the context provided, Uber's technology upgrade strategy is critical to their business model sustainability as failure to effectively upgrade their technology or network infrastructure could result in system disruptions, slow response times, and poor experiences for all stakeholders (Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers). The company acknowledges that substantial financial, operational, and technical resources must be committed to improve transaction processing, reporting systems, and controls to support their operations, particularly for high-growth segments like Delivery and Freight. However, Uber warns that their current systems may not be adequate to support future operations, indicating potential risks to long-term sustainability.","Based on the context provided, Uber's technology upgrade strategy is critical to their business model sustainability as failure to effectively upgrade their technology or network infrastructure could result in system disruptions, slow response times, and poor experiences for all stakeholders (Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers).

based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the 
success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates. 
Employee Development and Retention . We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, 
satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive th eir own growth, whether by lear ning on the job, finding stretch 
assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber th rough internal mobility programs.  
Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to 
have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to he lp our employees be their best selves by providing programs and  
resources that promote wellness and productiv ity. Globally, Uber offers competitive bene fits packages to our  employees and thei r

"What strategic challenges does Uber identify regarding financial reporting controls, and how do these relate to their acquisition strategy?","Based on the context, Uber identifies two key strategic challenges regarding financial reporting controls:

1. **Growth-related control design challenges**: Due to significant growth, especially in high-growth offerings like Delivery and Freight, Uber faces challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls to respond to evolving risks of material misstatement.

2. **Acquisition integration difficulties**: These financial control improvements are particularly challenging when acquiring new businesses with different systems, as Uber must integrate disparate financial and operational systems while maintaining adequate controls.","Based on the context, Uber identifies two key strategic challenges regarding financial reporting controls:

Overview 
We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, lead ing technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to 
power movement from point A to point B. We develop and opera te proprietary technology appli cations supporting a variety of 
offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of  ride services, merchants as we ll as delivery service provider s for 
meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also  connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use  this 
same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expert ise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight indust ry by 
providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services.

, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAA P 
financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe 
that these non-GAAP financial me asures provide meaningful supp lemental informatio n regarding our performance by excluding 
certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. 
We believe that both management  and investors benefit from re ferring to these non-GAAP financ ial measures in assessing our 
performance and when planning, fo recasting, and analyzing future  periods. These non-GAAP financia l measures also facilitate 
management’s internal co mparisons to our historic al performance. We believe these non-GAAP  financial measures are useful to 
investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and 
operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institu tional investors and the analyst co mmunity to help them analyze  the 
health of our business. Accordingly, we be lieve that these non-GAAP financial measures prov ide useful information to investors and 
others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in th e same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our 
calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ  from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our pe er 
companies.

Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several 
reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organiz ational structure or effectively manage our growth or any futu re 
reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. 
Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the 
complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant st rain on our manageme nt, personnel, operati ons, 
systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal  financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able  to 
manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 31,100 global em ployees, of whom approximately 18,000 were located outside 
the United States. The total number of our employees located outsi de the United States has increased and may continue to increa se as 
we expand globally. Properl y managing our growth will require us  to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and

adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to  expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in  an 
efficient manner, or if our operational tec hnology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers,  or 
Carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected a nd may cause platform users to sw itch to our competitors’ platforms, 
which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
Our organizational structure is complex and w ill continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers,  
Shippers, employees, products and offerings, a nd technologies, and as we continue to ex pand globally. We will need to improve o ur 
operational, financial, and management controls as well as our  reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our 
organizational structure. We will require ca pital and management resource s to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also 
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. 
Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -
Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.",73.82614610314711,1760.807752609253

• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to 
review potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers 
through Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or

third parties. Furthermore, operating a moto r vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addi tion, the growth of our Delivery offering  and 
launch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Dr ivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and 
bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while 
driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential  
injuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, n avigate, 
and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, 
all of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death.",66.68258521332876,636.6794109344482

h certain investors and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther 
stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified 
above and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social  related initiatives, whether du e to 
perceived over- or under-pursuit of  such initiatives, may result in  issues hiring or retaining em ployees, as well as potential 
investigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business.

Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adve rsely 
impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.

uccessfully transition into new roles, fo r example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attriti on, could 
have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key pers onnel 
and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect sm ooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future hav e an 
adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industr y 
experience. If we cannot effectivel y manage leadership transitions  and management changes in th e future, our reputation and fut ure 
business prospects could be adversely affected. 
To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to 
attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our busines s effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, 
retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase

our business model. 
In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restric tions and other requirements on 
operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United 
States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, 
rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Furt her, certain jurisdictions, incl uding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations b anning 
certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational rest rictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environ ment

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates.",50.059604885992584,107.421875
What types of legal vulnerabilities does Uber acknowledge regarding their Driver vetting procedures and platform safety claims?,"Based on the context, Uber acknowledges several legal vulnerabilities regarding their driver vetting and safety claims:

1. **Inadequate qualification processes**: They face civil litigation alleging inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, noting that Courier background checks are less extensive than Mobility Drivers and they don't independently test drivers' skills.

2. **Safety misrepresentations**: They acknowledge civil litigation for ""general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.""

3. **Criminal activity liability**: They face legal exposure from incidents where Drivers or individuals impersonating Drivers have engaged in serious crimes including sexual assault, abuse, kidnapping, and fatal injuries while using or claiming to use their platform.","Based on the context, Uber acknowledges several legal vulnerabilities regarding their driver vetting and safety claims:

complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or  threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have 
also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualifica tion processes and background checks, and general 
misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform. 
If Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impe rsonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropr iate 
conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offeri ngs 
safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which wo uld 
adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have  been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or 
individuals impersonating Drivers,  sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuri ng consumers, or otherwise eng aging 
in criminal activity while using our platfo rm or claiming to use our platform.

ut safety incidents reportedly occurring on 
or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and 
financial results. 
Further, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accide nts, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are 
caused by Drivers, consumers, or third partie s while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not 
actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consume rs or 
third parties. Furthermore, operating a moto r vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addi tion, the growth of our Delivery offering  and 
launch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Dr ivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and 
bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while 
driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential  
injuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, n avigate, 
and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, 
all of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death.

In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these 
legal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our bus iness. Others have been brought by taxica b

Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -
Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.

Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial ta xi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. Howeve r, 
numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including 
markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and

similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and Ne w York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for 
Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness

In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, 
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with ,

Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option fo r many workers historically marg inalized from the labor market 
and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service of ferings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that m ore 
can be done to improve the experi ence of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across 
countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent  workers are generally patchy compared with those that employ ees 
receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an 
employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independe nt worker who has access to relatively few. This does not h ave to 
be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not  have to come at the expense of security and dignity in wor k. 
Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues. 
• Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the

of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, wh ich involved payment of  $148 million and assurances that  we would enhance our data 
security and privacy prac tices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V . were each fined €2.12 million by 
the Italian data protection aut hority for alleged privacy viola tions stemming from an investig ation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in 
July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 
Breach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other 
penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the 
companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant

bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while

and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours,

such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of th e 
Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our  business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our 
assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets. 
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless o f 
our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your 
shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

br and and reputation, and while we have t aken significant steps to rehabilitate our 
brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. 
Maintaining and enhancing our  brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to 
preserve and deepen the engageme nt of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scru tiny, 
litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment. 
We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and 
fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity adversely affects our brand and reput ation, makes it difficult for us to attr act and 
retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulator y 
scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental i nvestigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, 
increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so. 
In 2024, we released a third safety report, which provides the publ ic with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other  
critical safety incidents claimed to have  occurred on our platform in the United Stat es.

l estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserv es, are subject to inherent 
variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement  process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited  historical 
experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resu lts depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be 
affected by many factors, such as claim se ttlement processes and changes in the econom ic, legal, and social environments. As a result, 
the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from 
the estimated amounts. 
While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less th an,

How does Uber's expansion into delivery services and lower-cost transportation options create new risk exposure categories for the company?,"Based on the context, Uber's expansion into delivery services and lower-cost transportation options has increased the number of drivers and consumers using two-wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles. This creates new risk exposure because these users are more vulnerable road users who face more severe injury levels in collisions compared to those in vehicles, particularly when navigating urban hazards like unpaved roadways and congested metropolitan areas with cars, buses, and light rail.","Based on the context, Uber's expansion into delivery services and lower-cost transportation options has increased the number of drivers and consumers using two-wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles.

and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, 
all of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death.

pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our 
network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. 
If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan ar eas in the 
future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, 
and operating results would suffer. 
In 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from tr ips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a 
result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptib le to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability 
of drivers using our platform to  provide trips to and from airports. Sustained dec lines in air travel have in the past, and may  in the 
future, suppress demand for airpor t-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from ai rport trips. For example, du ring 
the height of the pandemic, trav el behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing th e demand for Mobility to and from air ports. 
Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within air port boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders 
obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations 
altogether.

and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates. 
Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option fo r many workers historically marg inalized from the labor market 
and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service of ferings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that m ore 
can be done to improve the experi ence of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across 
countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent  workers are generally patchy compared with those that employ ees 
receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an 
employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independe nt worker who has access to relatively few. This does not h ave to 
be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not  have to come at the expense of security and dignity in wor k. 
Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues. 
• Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 
social safety net.",88.62545157909511,161.35549545288086

Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.",72.73132214487791,127.854585647583

views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another cate gory of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, 
help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with lo w ratings 
or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Dr ivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with

may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissat isfaction has in the past resu lted in 
protests by Drivers in various regions, incl uding India, the United Kingdom, and the Un ited States. Such protests have resulted , and 
any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business.  Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline  in our 
number of platform users, which would reduc e our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform u sage. 
Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shi ppers, or Carriers using our plat form would reduce the value of our 
network and would harm our future operating results.

Drivers may become subject to in creased licensing requirements, and we may be re quired to obtain additional licenses or cap the  
number of Drivers using our platform. 
Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial ta xi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. Howeve r, 
numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including 
markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and 
Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be  licensed with local authorities or require us or our 
subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect 
our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of 
licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or im pose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, 
similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and Ne w York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for 
Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our 
business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are 
required to purchase additional in surance for other aspects of our business, or if  we fail to comply w ith regulations governing  
insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. 
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobilit y products may include thir d-party automobile, automob ile comprehensive and collisi on, 
physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured  motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most 
countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf  of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insura nce

to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and featur es that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shipper s, and 
Carriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors. For example, in January 2020, we  introduced a number of product change s in 
California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected 
fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthe n the 
independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. 
Developing and delivering new or upgraded pr oducts, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, 
offerings, and features depends on several factors, including th e timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of suc h 
products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, or features may not work as intended  or 
may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may

Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery,

refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed

Overview 
We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, lead ing technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to 
power movement from point A to point B. We develop and opera te proprietary technology appli cations supporting a variety of 
offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of  ride services, merchants as we ll as delivery service provider s for 
meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also  connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use  this 
same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expert ise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight indust ry by 
providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services.

ut safety incidents reportedly occurring on 
or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and 
financial results. 
Further, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accide nts, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are 
caused by Drivers, consumers, or third partie s while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not 
actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consume rs or 
third parties. Furthermore, operating a moto r vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addi tion, the growth of our Delivery offering  and 
launch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Dr ivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and 
bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while 
driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential  
injuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, n avigate, 
and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, 
all of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death.

ployees be their best selves by providing programs and  
resources that promote wellness and productiv ity. Globally, Uber offers competitive bene fits packages to our  employees and thei r 
families.  
For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining a nd attracting high- quality personnel, 
and continued attrition, future attrition,  or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included i n Part I, 
Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Driver and Courier Well-Being 
In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, 
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates.",55.581944712045185,151.36218070983887
What strategic challenge does Uber acknowledge regarding the relationship between business expansion and insurance coverage adequacy?,"Based on the context, Uber acknowledges that ""as we expand our products and offerings, this insurance risk will grow.""

or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and bus iness customers of Freight and Uber

We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. 
Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calc ulate consumer fares and Driver earnings.

nal lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices. 
Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our 
business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are 
required to purchase additional in surance for other aspects of our business, or if  we fail to comply w ith regulations governing  
insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. 
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobilit y products may include thir d-party automobile, automob ile comprehensive and collisi on, 
physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured  motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most 
countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf  of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insura nce 
providers, and should such providers discontinue  or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to  
secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.

rove access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 
social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app ba sed companies—to provide benefi ts and protections to their 
users without compromising the flex ibility of their use of the app.  Some examples of our advocacy  to preserve flexibility of 
work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows: 
◦ In Washington State, we partnered with industry and labor to support a bill regulati ng rideshare, including minimum 
earnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers’ compensation coverage for drivers. 
◦ In New York and Massachusetts, we reached agreements wi th the Attorneys General that introduce new protections 
for rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits. 
◦ In France, we reached a number of sectoral bargaining agreements with elected workers’ representatives to 
implement new standards related to minimum guaranteed reve nues for couriers, minimum fare per trip for drivers, 
and deactivation transparency and appeals process for both.

independent workers.",120.36380138835628,123.12459945678712

Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther

variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also 
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. 
Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

Our Segments 
As of December 31, 2024, we had three operating and reportab le segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery

Mobility 
Our Mobility offering connects consumers with  a wide range of transpor tation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, 
micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more—helping cu stomers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global 
leadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data that  comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and 
data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.  
We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities.

Freight 
We believe that Freight is revolutionizi ng the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics networ k 
and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, bran d 
awareness, and experience revolutionizing i ndustries. Freight provides an on-demand plat form to automate and accelerate logisti cs

solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand  with 
real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to deliv ery. Freight operations are principally based in North America  and 
Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent signifi cant efficiency improvements ove r traditional transportation mana gement

initiatives and activities by investors, lenders, regulators, customers, employees and other stakeholders. We have taken, and m ay 
continue to take, certain environmental and social actions, in cluding the establishment of environmental and social goals, incl uding 
those that relate to climate change matters. The increased focus on environmental and social initiatives and evolving stakehold er 
expectations may present operational, regulat ory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks and impacts, which could have  an 
adverse impact on our business, including on our reputation and stoc k price. For example, investors and lenders may reconsider their 
capital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of  our environmental and social practices, which may impact our a ccess to 
capital. 
Our ability to meet our environmental and social goals is depende nt on many external factors, including such factors as rapidly  
changing regulatory developments, government al or political shifts, policies and rela ted interpretation, action from policymake rs and 
the wider auto industry, advances in technology such as battery st orage, industry-wide investment, as well as the availability, cost and 
accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the av ailability of critical EV charging infrastru cture that can be efficiently accessed b y Drivers; 
progress has been made, but without mo

h certain investors and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther 
stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified 
above and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social  related initiatives, whether du e to 
perceived over- or under-pursuit of  such initiatives, may result in  issues hiring or retaining em ployees, as well as potential 
investigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business. 
General Economic Risks 
Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adve rsely

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.",54.602789545597865,736.5779876708984

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

and deactivation transparency and appeals process for both. 
• Protections and benefits : We partner with leading insurance companie s around the world to pioneer protections for 
independent workers.  
• Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Driver s can use to acquire information that may help them 
save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential 
is highest).  
• Learning and Growth : We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible 
Drivers and/or their family members through undergraduat e degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills  
9 
development and language learning. For example, since its launc h in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has 
enrolled nearly 15,000 Drivers and their family members in English language learning and entrepreneurship courses. 
• Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our 
platform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anyw here, both inside and outside our company. In locations around 
the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to partic ipate in meaningful dialogue w ith us. In markets across the 
world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations a nd conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our 
support services, and other matters.",83.26411601312577,640.5603885650635
How does the writing style balance promotional language about acquisitions with cautionary messaging about potential liabilities?,"The writing style presents acquisitions in straightforward, factual terms (citing specific examples like Cornershop for grocery delivery, Drizly for alcohol delivery, and Transplace for freight management) while immediately following with explicit cautionary language about risks.

In addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other 
similar laws outside the United States. Our existing and pl anned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to 
discourage corrupt practices by such partie s, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we coul d be 
held responsible. 
We may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether 
these transactions will be accretive to th e value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, 
joint ventures, or other strategic transac tions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users,  or 
regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputa tion and our business. Any of th ese factors may adversely affect  our 
ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results. 
We cannot guarantee that our share repurcha se program will be fully consummated or th at it will enhance long-term stockholder

Although our board of directors has authoriz ed a share repurchase program, the program  does not obligate us to repurchase any 
specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shar es of our common stock.

Acquisitions 
We account for acquisitions of entities or  asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business 
Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The pu rchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible a nd intangible assets acquired an d 
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those f air values 
is recorded as goodwill. During th e measurement period, which may be up to one year from the ac quisition date, we may record 
adjustments to the assets acquired and lia bilities assumed with  the corresponding offset to goo dwill. Upon the conclusion of th e 
measurement period or final determination of  the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any 
subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated. 
As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect  to continue to enter into, ag reements to acquire companies, 
form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business,  sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, a nd acquire 
complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is 
intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target fo r acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on 
commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive a pproval from the applicable comp etition authorities, or such targ et 
may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.  
Further, negotiations for potentia l acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and  
significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and suc h 
indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to  make interest and principal payments.",123.4553945714646,306.92338943481445

Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regul ations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or 
mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehi cles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their 
destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply w ith rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehic le 
inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters. 
In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that a pply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. This 
uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates signifi cant complexities for our business and operating model. As we 
continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additi onal regulations separate from those that apply to our existing pr oducts.

1. **Financial and legal risks** - including claims and liabilities (such as personal injury claims), new expenses, and insufficient revenue generation to offset costs
2. **Market and competitive risks** - including uncertain consumer demand, lack of market acceptance, and potential obsolescence from competitor products

Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther 
stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

ng firms. As a global organization, Uber undergoes 
annual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1 
Merchant and Service provider. Uber also undergoes annual audits to maintain its ISO 27001 certification for its core 
mobility, delivery, and enterprise businesses, and SOC 2 attestations that vary depending on the Uber product.

• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to 
review potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers 
through Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or 
users; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of su ch incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent 
recurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations 
triggered in connection with any such incidents.  
• Third Party Risk Management.  Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and 
business partners. This includes requiring submission of evid ence demonstrating third partie s’ ability to meet Uber’s 
cybersecurity and data handling requirements.

w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate. 
There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate , or 
that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or ma rket acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any n ew expenses 
or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that  products and offerings developed by others will render our 
products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our de velopment efforts with respect to new products, offerings and  
technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established 
products, offerings and technologies. Even if  we are successful in developing new pr oducts, offerings or technologies, regulato ry 
authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in re sponse to our innovations that coul d increase our expenses or prev ent us 
from successfully commercializing new products, offerings or tec hnologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our 
investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.",71.50150621145136,1211.6742134094238
What strategic concern does Uber express regarding management focus and resource allocation when pursuing new product development initiatives?,"Based on the context, Uber expresses concern that their development efforts for new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from their more established products, offerings and technologies. This indicates a strategic concern about maintaining focus on existing business while pursuing innovation initiatives.","Based on the context, Uber expresses concern that their development efforts for new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from their more established products, offerings and technologies.

to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and featur es that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shipper s, and 
Carriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors. For example, in January 2020, we  introduced a number of product change s in 
California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected 
fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthe n the 
independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. 
Developing and delivering new or upgraded pr oducts, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, 
offerings, and features depends on several factors, including th e timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of suc h 
products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, or features may not work as intended  or 
may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may 
continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced suppl y of Drivers on our platform, Dr iver dissatisfaction, and adve rse  
24 
impacts on the operation of our platform.

gs. For example, through our acquisiti on of 
Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior 
development or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate.

apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction,

allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also 
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. 
Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -
Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.

Substantially all states in the United States and numerous muni cipalities in the United States and around the world have adopte d 
Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regul ations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or 
mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehi cles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their 
destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply w ith rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehic le 
inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters. 
In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that a pply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. This 
uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates signifi cant complexities for our business and operating model. As we 
continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additi onal regulations separate from those that apply to our existing pr oducts.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statemen ts of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemabl e 
non-controlling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the 
related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the acco mpanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial 
statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on cr iteria 
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of S ponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).

tion, operating results, and cash flows. 
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in mu ltiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisd ictions. We are unable to predict 
what other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in  the future or what effects such future changes would have o n our 
business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, polic ies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate coul d increase 
the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial positi on, future 
operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we  have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; a nd 
increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxe s in 
one or more jurisdictions where we operate . The governments of countries in which we  operate and other governmental bodies coul d 
make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in th eir jurisdictions that are cont rary to the way in which we have 
interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations de scribed above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New 
laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the count ries in which we do business or require us to change the mann er in 
which we operate our business.

alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that cha racterize 
these industries. As we and our competito rs introduce new products and offerings, and as ex isting products  evolve, we expect to  
become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally a nd introduce new products and offerings across a range 
of industries, many of  our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing 
them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in eac h of

and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates. 
Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option fo r many workers historically marg inalized from the labor market 
and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service of ferings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that m ore 
can be done to improve the experi ence of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across 
countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent  workers are generally patchy compared with those that employ ees 
receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an

Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

gs. For example, through our acquisiti on of 
Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior 
development or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate.

annual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1 
Merchant and Service provider. Uber also undergoes annual audits to maintain its ISO 27001 certification for its core 
mobility, delivery, and enterprise businesses, and SOC 2 attestations that vary depending on the Uber product.

• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to 
review potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers 
through Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or 
users; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of su ch incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent 
recurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations 
triggered in connection with any such incidents.  
• Third Party Risk Management.  Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and 
business partners. This includes requiring submission of evid ence demonstrating third partie s’ ability to meet Uber’s 
cybersecurity and data handling requirements.",74.4075090789407,131.4990520477295

Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.",142.9032295587013,128.4623146057129
How does the company's tone in describing international regulatory challenges reflect its approach to risk disclosure for investors?,"Based on the context provided, Uber's tone in describing international regulatory challenges is comprehensive and cautionary, systematically listing multiple specific risk categories including restrictive laws, competition from local entities, social acceptance issues, and legal uncertainties. This detailed enumeration of potential obstacles reflects a thorough risk disclosure approach that aims to inform investors of the wide range of regulatory and operational challenges the company faces in international markets. The methodical presentation suggests the company is being transparent about the complexity and breadth of international expansion risks.","Based on the context provided, Uber's tone in describing international regulatory challenges is comprehensive and cautionary, systematically listing multiple specific risk categories including restrictive laws, competition from local entities, social acceptance issues, and legal uncertainties.

challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition. 
Our historical workplace culture and forw ard-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a 
failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. 
Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have  in 
the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our bu siness results and financial cond ition. Our prior failure to pri oritize 
compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Althoug h we have since made changes in our company’s cultural val ues 
and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote tran sparency and collaboration, regulators may 
continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.  
If platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violen t, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major s afety 
incidents, our ability to attract and retain  Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers , and Carriers may be harmed, which could 
have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.

h certain investors and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther 
stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified 
above and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social  related initiatives, whether du e to 
perceived over- or under-pursuit of  such initiatives, may result in  issues hiring or retaining em ployees, as well as potential 
investigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business.

the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. 
Based on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have 
sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. H owever, 
our judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to 
many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our bus iness plans and/or tax planning  
strategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in th e recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated b alance 
sheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded. 
Insurance Reserves 
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiary, to provide for the potential li abilities for certain risks, including au to liability, uninsured and underinsured mo torist, auto 
physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.

y assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinatio ns 
and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. 
The income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the 
release of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits 
and other non-material deferred tax assets. 
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider 
both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight 
of all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than -not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  
As of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U. S. pre-tax book income adjusted for 
permanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual pe riod ended on December 31, 2024,  we 
utilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both 
objective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.

ed on a combination of options valued  using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  We determine volatility over an expected 
term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.  
91 
Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability met hod, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. 
We account for uncertainty in tax positions  recognized in the consolid ated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit fr om 
an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be  sustained upon examination, including resol utions of 
any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the techni cal merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-n ot 
recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. 
We recognize accrued interest a nd penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income tax es 
in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce de ferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not 
expected to be realized based on the wei ghting of positive and negative evidence.",63.11503831088137,105.5161952972412

As of December 31, 2024, our platform is av ailable in more than 15,000 cities in over 70 countries. We are subject to differing , 
and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of 
proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in 
foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and m aterially 
harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we ope rate our business, increasin g our 
operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.

Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

enforcement agency. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit ou r future 
acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth. 
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial 
services. 
Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain 
jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licen ses to 
continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subs idiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V ., is registered an d 
authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as  an electronic money institution.  This authorization permits Ub er 
Payments B.V . to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as 
referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/ EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addi tion, 
Uber Payments B.V . has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other 
countries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a si milar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduc t

recognized a UK driver union and in 2024, voters in Massachusetts approved a ballot initiative allowing drivers to collectively bargain 
as independent contractors. If a significa nt number of Drivers were to become uni onized and collective bargaining agreement ter ms

rove access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 
social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app ba sed companies—to provide benefi ts and protections to their 
users without compromising the flex ibility of their use of the app.  Some examples of our advocacy  to preserve flexibility of 
work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows: 
◦ In Washington State, we partnered with industry and labor to support a bill regulati ng rideshare, including minimum 
earnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers’ compensation coverage for drivers. 
◦ In New York and Massachusetts, we reached agreements wi th the Attorneys General that introduce new protections 
for rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits. 
◦ In France, we reached a number of sectoral bargaining agreements with elected workers’ representatives to 
implement new standards related to minimum guaranteed reve nues for couriers, minimum fare per trip for drivers, 
and deactivation transparency and appeals process for both. 
• Protections and benefits : We partner with leading insurance companie s around the world to pioneer protections for 
independent workers.

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram

This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

Conducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks th at we 
do not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others: 
• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

Drivers may become subject to in creased licensing requirements, and we may be re quired to obtain additional licenses or cap the  
number of Drivers using our platform. 
Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial ta xi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. Howeve r, 
numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including 
markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and 
Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be  licensed with local authorities or require us or our 
subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect 
our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of 
licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or im pose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, 
similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and Ne w York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for 
Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness 
and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

d other goods. 
Substantially all states in the United States and numerous muni cipalities in the United States and around the world have adopte d 
Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regul ations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or 
mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehi cles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their 
destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply w ith rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehic le 
inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters. 
In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that a pply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. This 
uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates signifi cant complexities for our business and operating model. As we 
continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additi onal regulations separate from those that apply to our existing pr oducts.

investment company as defi ned by the Investment Compa ny Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be  
deemed an investment company, such a determination would requi re us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply

What is Uber's primary strategic approach for participating in markets where it faces regulatory or competitive challenges rather than operating independently?,"Based on the context, Uber's primary strategic approach for participating in markets where it faces regulatory or competitive challenges is partnering with and investing in local ridesharing and delivery companies rather than operating independently. This strategy has resulted in Uber holding minority ownership positions in companies like Didi, Grab, and Aurora. The company has also divested certain lines of business entirely and instead partnered with and invested in other companies in those business areas.","Based on the context, Uber's primary strategic approach for participating in markets where it faces regulatory or competitive challenges is partnering with and investing in local ridesharing and delivery companies rather than operating independently.

such as well-being, fairness, re wards and recognition, and growth  opportunities. For example, our  hybrid work approach was shap ed 
based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the 
success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates. 
Employee Development and Retention . We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, 
satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive th eir own growth, whether by lear ning on the job, finding stretch 
assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber th rough internal mobility programs.  
Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to 
have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to he lp our employees be their best selves by providing programs and  
resources that promote wellness and productiv ity. Globally, Uber offers competitive bene fits packages to our  employees and thei r 
families.

promotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pric ing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than t hose 
that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater reso urces and 
access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier  bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our comp etitors 
in certain geographic markets en joy substantial competitive adva ntages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating hist ories, 
larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more s upportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may  be  
13 
able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing oppor tunities, technologies, consumer 
preferences, regulations, or standards, wh ich may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competi tors may 
share in the eff ective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without hav ing to 
incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.

gs. For example, through our acquisiti on of 
Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous 
vehicle technologies on our platform. For ex ample, in January 2021, we completed th e merger of our au tonomous technologies

which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launc h and commercialization of self-d riving vehicles on our rideshari ng

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Description of Business 
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is 
headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, 
operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary 
technology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers 
(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other 
consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.

allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also 
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. 
Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -
Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.",123.24234074631036,108.37888717651369

Trip volumes. Freight Gross Bookings declined 2% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis. 
Revenue was $44.0 billion, up 18% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gro ss Bookings of 18%. The increase 
in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an  increase in Mobility and Delivery Trip vol umes. The increase in revenue was partia lly 
offset by business model changes in some countries that classifi ed certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which 
negatively impacted revenue by $863 million and $713 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively.

This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

progress has been made, but without more a ggressive action, we cannot achieve all of our goals. All of our climate change-relat ed 
goals are intentionally challenging, and are therefore subject to  risks, uncertainties, third pa rty information or action, and conditions, 
many of which are outside of our control. Progressing towards our climate goals requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and 
management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or 
climate goals. For example, when we set our 2025 climate goals, we  anticipated that strong regulatory measures, alongside susta ined 
industry-wide investment , would support our efforts. While progress has been made, without more aggressive action from 
policymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated.

December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statemen ts of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemabl e

established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of S ponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).

operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has al so included the divestment of certain lines of business in th eir 
entirety, and not just in certain jurisdic tions, and instead partnering and investing in  other companies in those lines of busi ness. As a 
result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, and Aurora. 
Our ownership in these entities involves si gnificant risks that are outside our control. As a result, these companies may make 
decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. 
Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the fu ture. 
While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in  these companies, our business, financial condition, operating r esults, 
and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion.

Any material decline in the business of these entities would adve rsely affect the value of our assets and our financial results .

Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significan t unobservable inputs or data in inactive 
markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of ma rket prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified  as 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimate d fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we  utilize 
the most recent data available including observed transactions such  as equity financing transacti ons of the investees and sales  of the 
existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the de termination of whether an observed transaction is similar to t he equity 
and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. 
We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securitie s quarterly for impairment. The impairment analys is 
for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative anal ysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance,  industry 
and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity i nvestment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new  
carrying value for the investment and rec ognize an impairment loss through our conso lidated statement of operations.

primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. gove rnment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and 
investment-grade corporate debt securities . We do not enter into investments for tr ading or speculative purposes. Investments i n fixed 
rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in  rates would primarily impact in terest income due to the relati vely short-

We are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, 
privately-held entities and public  companies, compared to  their fair value. We hold privat ely held investments in illiquid priv ate

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

ion that platform users share with us is vital to our business. One key way that 
Uber addresses this need is through its cybersecurity program, which includes a cybersecurity risk management program. 
Uber’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is respons ible for the cybersecurity program, which is coordinated and 
primarily executed by the global organization of engineers focu sed on risk management using the NIST Framework (Govern, Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and activities such as automation, secure development, and advanced analytics and 
monitoring. The CISO has served in such role since February 202 1 and has more than 20+ years of  engineering and/or cybersecurit y 
experience, including previously as CISO and Deputy Chief Technology Officer at a Fortune 500 company. 
The cybersecurity program is also supported by Uber’s Chie f Privacy Officer and Associate General Counsel, Privacy & 
Cybersecurity (“CPO”), who has served in that role since August 2018. The CPO has over three decades of experience as a legal 
advisor to multinational corporat ions, including serving as Chief Privacy & Security Counsel fo r a Fortune 100 technology compa ny 
prior to her role at Uber. 
The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer.

ng firms. As a global organization, Uber undergoes 
annual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1 
Merchant and Service provider. Uber also undergoes annual audits to maintain its ISO 27001 certification for its core 
mobility, delivery, and enterprise businesses, and SOC 2 attestations that vary depending on the Uber product.

• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to 
review potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers 
through Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or 
users; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of su ch incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent 
recurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations 
triggered in connection with any such incidents.  
• Third Party Risk Management.  Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and 
business partners. This includes requiring submission of evid ence demonstrating third partie s’ ability to meet Uber’s 
cybersecurity and data handling requirements.",122.1116770770596,127.66647338867188

operating our business. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding inde btedness of $9.6 billion aggregate pr incipal amount. In addition, up to 
approximately $128 million of  Careem Convertible Notes remain  subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of 
December 31, 2024. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our  existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may  incur 
additional debt, secure existing or future de bt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the 
purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. 
We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations  to pay interest and principal on our 
indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporat e 
purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and o ther 
investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in  our 
business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flex ibility in planning for, or r eacting to, changes in our busine ss and the 
industry, and prevent us from ta king advantage of busines s opportunities as they arise.

What are the primary risk factors Uber identifies when investing in companies with limited operating histories in evolving industries?,"Based on the context, Uber identifies several primary risk factors when investing in companies with limited operating histories in evolving industries: these companies may have less predictable operating results; limited public information is available for privately owned companies, preventing Uber from learning all material information; they operate in countries with economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks; they depend heavily on a small group of key individuals whose departure could adversely affect operations; and they will likely require substantial additional capital to support operations and maintain competitive positions.","Based on the context, Uber identifies several primary risk factors when investing in companies with limited operating histories in evolving industries: these companies may have less predictable operating results; limited public information is available for privately owned companies, preventing Uber from learning all material information; they operate in countries with economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks; they depend heavily on a small group of key individuals whose departure could adversely affect operations; and they will likely require substantial additional capital to support operations and maintain competitive posit.","gs.

Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior 
development or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate.

Carriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors. For example, in January 2020, we  introduced a number of product change s in 
California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected 
fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthe n the 
independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. 
Developing and delivering new or upgraded pr oducts, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, 
offerings, and features depends on several factors, including th e timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of suc h 
products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, or features may not work as intended  or 
may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) 
We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering peri od. 
The ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately si x 
months. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price o f 
either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under th e ESPP

term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility.",53.275194298913085,114.02583122253418

Further, we are contractually lim ited in our ability to sell or tr ansfer these assets. For exampl e, in connection with Aurora’s  
November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may 
be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value o f these

“Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements 
of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pa y significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. 
Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses. 
We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unabl e to achieve or sustain profitability, our 
prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.

Overview 
We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, lead ing technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to 
power movement from point A to point B. We develop and opera te proprietary technology appli cations supporting a variety of 
offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of  ride services, merchants as we ll as delivery service provider s for 
meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also  connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use  this 
same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expert ise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight indust ry by 
providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services.

investment company as defi ned by the Investment Compa ny Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be  
deemed an investment company, such a determination would requi re us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply

such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of th e

Further, we are contractually lim ited in our ability to sell or tr ansfer these assets. For exampl e, in connection with Aurora’s  
November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may 
be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value o f these

Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily  an indication of future performance. These fluctuations ma y 
be a result of a variety of factors, some  of which are beyond our control. In additi on, we experience seas onal fluctuations in our 
financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher reve nue in our fourth quarter compar ed to other quarters due in p art to 
fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate  lower revenue in our first quarter compared to other quarter s due 
in part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth 
in Mobility trends in the first quarter. Fo r Delivery, we expect to experience seasona l increases in our revenue in the fourth quarter 
compared to other quarters, although the historical growth of De livery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. Our growth has m ade, 
and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over 
time as our growth slows. Other seasonal tr ends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which 
would contribute to fluctuations in our op erating results.

racterized by ra pid technological a dvances, our ability to compete 
successfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We 
continue to develop new technologies to en hance existing offerings and services, and to  expand the range of our offerings throu gh 
research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.

Mobility 
We typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operati ng results as we generate highe r Gross Bookings in our fourth 
quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and busine ss demand, and typically generate lower Gros

Human Capital at Uber 
Employees 
We are a global company and as of December 31, 2024, we a nd our subsidiaries had approximately 31, 100 employees globally 
and operations in over 70 countries and more than 15,000 cities around the world.

pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our 
network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. 
If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan ar eas in the 
future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, 
and operating results would suffer. 
In 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from tr ips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a 
result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptib le to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability 
of drivers using our platform to  provide trips to and from airports. Sustained dec lines in air travel have in the past, and may  in the 
future, suppress demand for airpor t-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from ai rport trips. For example, du ring 
the height of the pandemic, trav el behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing th e demand for Mobility to and from air ports. 
Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within air port boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders 
obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations 
altogether.",143.66573286792263,157.56583213806152

te a trip via the Platform, amounts charged to end-users for Mobility services, and fees charged to end-
users for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.  
Depending on the market where the trip is comp leted, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the 
difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount  earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference 
between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesha ring 
services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance fo r the ridesharing services provided. We typically receive the service 
fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip. 
In certain markets, end-users have the option to pay cash for trips. Service fees for cash trips are recognized only when colle cted 
from Drivers as we concluded that collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. 
Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products. 
Delivery 
We derive our Delivery revenue from service fees paid by Couriers  and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to 
successfully complete meal preparation, grocery and other delivery service on the platform, amounts charged to end-users for Delivery 
services, and fees charged to end-users for use of the platform in certain markets.",138.09063186130152,142.99392700195312

rmine that an entity for which we hold a c ontractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and 
that we are the primary beneficiary, we c onsolidate such entity in the consolidated financial st atements. The primary beneficia ry of a 
VIE is the party that meets both of the foll owing criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the 
economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb  losses or the right to receive benefits that in either ca se could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodi cally, we determine whether any changes in  the interest or relationship with the entity 
impact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not d eemed to 
be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with appl icable 
GAAP. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information. 
Revenue Recognition 
We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive revenue from Driver s’ and Merchants’ use of our 
platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, includi ng facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables 
Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services

Presentation of Mobility and Deli very Revenue Agreements, Incl uding Incentives, Discounts and Promo tions to Drivers, Merchants 
and End-Users 
As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues from Drivers’ and 
Merchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Deliv ery

additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. 
Further, we are contractually lim ited in our ability to sell or tr ansfer these assets. For exampl e, in connection with Aurora’s  
November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may 
be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value o f these 
assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment comp any under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 
“Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements 
of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pa y significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. 
Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses. 
We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unabl e to achieve or sustain profitability, our 
prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. 
Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily  an indication of future performance.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expe ct, we may not be able to main tain profitability, which would 
adversely affect our financial results and future prospects. 
We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

• increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform; 
• continue to introduce our platform to new markets; 
• provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers; 
• expand our business and increase our market share and category position; 
• compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors; 
• develop new products, offerings, and technologies; 
• identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offe rings, or technologies that we believe could complement or 
expand our platform; 
• penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

Overview 
We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, lead ing technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to 
power movement from point A to point B. We develop and opera te proprietary technology appli cations supporting a variety of 
offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of  ride services, merchants as we ll as delivery service provider s for 
meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also  connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use  this 
same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expert ise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight indust ry by 
providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services.

Driver and Courier Well-Being 
In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, 
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates.

treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundame ntally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our pr oducts 
and offerings, or dissatisf action with our products a nd offerings in general. In addition,  if we are unable to provide high-qua lity 
support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, includi ng safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to 
attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish 
or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging us ers to cease use of our platform takes h old, if 
we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we  cannot otherwise attract and retain a la rge number of Drivers, consumers, mer chants, 
Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expe ct, we may not be able to main tain profitability, which would 
adversely affect our financial results and future prospects. 
We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: 
• grow supply and demand on our platform; 
• increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform; 
• continue to introduce our platform to new markets; 
• provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers; 
• expand our business and increase our market share and category position; 
• compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors; 
• develop new products, offerings, and technologies; 
• identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offe rings, or technologies that we believe could complement or 
expand our platform; 
• penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;

alternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;

concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adve rse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An 
economic downturn, increased competition, or  regulatory obstacles in any of these ke y metropolitan areas w ould adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and operating results to a much great er degree than would the occurrence of such events in other  areas. 
In addition, any changes to local laws or  regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or  increase 
our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing 
licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inabili ty to 
operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely aff ect our 
business, financial condition, and operating results. 
Further, we expect that we will continue  to face challenges in pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our 
network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.

If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan ar eas in the 
future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, 
and operating results would suffer. 
In 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from tr ips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a 
result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptib le to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability 
of drivers using our platform to  provide trips to and from airports. Sustained dec lines in air travel have in the past, and may  in the 
future, suppress demand for airpor t-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from ai rport trips. For example, du ring 
the height of the pandemic, trav el behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing th e demand for Mobility to and from air ports. 
Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within air port boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders 
obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations 
altogether.",147.85381228018952,148.4355926513672

Competitive Environment 
We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face  significant competition in each  of the mobility and delivery  
industries globally and in the logistics i ndustry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost  
alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that cha racterize 
these industries. As we and our competito rs introduce new products and offerings, and as ex isting products  evolve, we expect to  
become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally a nd introduce new products and offerings across a range 
of industries, many of  our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing 
them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in eac h of 
our offerings includes:

• Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle owne rship and usage, which acc ounts for the majority of 
passenger miles in the markets that we se rve, and traditional transportation servic es, including taxicab companies and taxi-
hailing services, livery and other car services.

expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.  As we and our competitors  introduce new products and 
offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors  may 
adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers valu e more 
highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to diff erentiate our products. Increase d 
competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the numbe r of 
platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins. 
We face competition in each of our offerings, including: 
• Mobility. Our Mobility offering compet es with personal vehicle ow nership and usage, which a ccounts for the majority of 
passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditio nal transportation services, including taxicab companies and 
taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,  public transportation can be a superior substitute to our 
Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower- cost travel option in many cities.

such as well-being, fairness, re wards and recognition, and growth  opportunities. For example, our  hybrid work approach was shap ed 
based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the 
success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates. 
Employee Development and Retention . We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, 
satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive th eir own growth, whether by lear ning on the job, finding stretch 
assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber th rough internal mobility programs.  
Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to 
have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to he lp our employees be their best selves by providing programs and  
resources that promote wellness and productiv ity. Globally, Uber offers competitive bene fits packages to our  employees and thei r 
families.

gs. For example, through our acquisiti on of 
Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior 
development or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate.

The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram 
through regular updates.  
This cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews 
business, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is 
designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. 
Key elements of this program include:  
• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to 
cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and 
Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and 
annual reports by the CPO to the Board. 
The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim 
updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership.

updates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership. The CISO and CPO also 
jointly chair Uber’s Privacy and Cybersecurity Council, which provides a venue for cross-functional insight and input into 
the cybersecurity program and our privacy program as they relate to Uber’s business operations. 
• Internally conducted environment and vulnerability assessments.  These include regular assessments performed by 
Uber’s security engineering teams. The findings from thes e assessments are reported to Uber’s senior management, 
including the CISO, and the Board or Audit Committee. In a ddition, our internal audit function periodically conducts 
additional reviews and assessments, which are reported to th e Audit Committee. We also conduct table-top exercises to 
simulate the response to cybersecurity incidents; partic ipants may include, among others, the CISO, the CPO, and 
representatives from communications, investor relations, finance and legal. 
• Independent third-party audits and assessments by industry-leading firms. As a global organization, Uber undergoes 
annual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1

through Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or 
users; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of su ch incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent 
recurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations 
triggered in connection with any such incidents.  
• Third Party Risk Management.  Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and 
business partners. This includes requiring submission of evid ence demonstrating third partie s’ ability to meet Uber’s

policymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated. There can be
