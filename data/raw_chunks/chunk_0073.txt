ess coverage and our reputation and business may be 
harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions  that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequent ly, our 
business. 
While we have taken significant steps to re habilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will  
depend largely on maintaining a good reputation,  minimizing the number of safety incide nts, continuing an improved culture and 
workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, continuing to invest in safety features and improvements, maintaining a

high quality of service and ethi cal behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, 
reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other 
competitors and potential competitors will e xpand their offerings, which will make main taining and enhanci ng our reputation and  
brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to su ccessfully maintain our brand in the current or future competi tive 
environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would 
be further damaged and our business may suffer.
