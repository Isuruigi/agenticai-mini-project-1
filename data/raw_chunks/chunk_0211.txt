Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our 
business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are 
required to purchase additional in surance for other aspects of our business, or if  we fail to comply w ith regulations governing  
insurance coverage, our business could be harmed. 
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobilit y products may include thir d-party automobile, automob ile comprehensive and collisi on, 
physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured  motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most 
countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf  of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insura nce 
providers, and should such providers discontinue  or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to  
secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.
