our existing stockholders may suffer signifi cant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences,  and 
privileges superior to those of existing st ockholders. Certain of our exis ting debt instruments contai n, and any debt financing  we 
secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants rela ting to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other fi
nancial and 
operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtai n additional capital with whic h to pursue business opportunities . For 
example, our existing debt instruments cont ain significant restrictions on our ability  to incur additional secured indebtedness . We may 
not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if  at all. If we are unable to obt ain adequate financing or fina ncing on 
terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business chall enges 
and competition may be significantly limited. 
We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in th e future incur additional indebted ness. Our payment obligations 
under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in 
operating our business. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding inde btedness of $9.6 billion aggregate pr incipal amount.
