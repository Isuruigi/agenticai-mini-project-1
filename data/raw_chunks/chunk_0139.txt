factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, 
reductions in net worth, residential real es tate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confid ence, 
tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditi ons, including slower growth or recession, 
inflation and higher interest rates, changes in labor market dynamics, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our res ults 
of operations. For example, inflation has in creased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift 
to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In s uch 
circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower pr ice-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering , 
may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicl e or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total mi les

business, financial condition, and operating results.
