claims, personal injury  claims, challenge s to regulations , and 
other matters. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any 
claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time c onsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could requir e 
significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to 
us, or we were to enter into a settlement, we could be exposed to  monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we 
operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
In addition, we regularly include arbitrat ion provisions in our terms of service with  end-users. These provisions are intended to 
streamline the litigation process fo r all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than lit igating 
disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may beco me more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and 
become burdensome. Further, the use of arb itration provisions may subject us to certain  risks to our reputation and brand, as t hese 
provisions have been the subject of increasi ng public scrutiny.
