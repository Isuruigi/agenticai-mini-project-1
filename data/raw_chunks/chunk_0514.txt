Prior to their redemption in October 2024, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor was considered a related party to Freight Holding. 
We do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s loss to the redeem able non-controlling inte rests in Series A 
Preferred shares of Freight Holding because these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not particip ate in 
losses that would cause their interest to be below the liquida tion preference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferr ed stock 
are entitled to the greater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation pref erence on their initial investment, as well as 6% continuously  
compounding cumulative dividends that will be  paid before any distribution to common shar eholders or (ii) the fair value of the ir 
investment (the “Freight Series  A Liquidation Preference”). The di vidend, along with any attribut ed prorated share of Freight 
Holding’s net income (if ap plicable), are included in  net income (loss) attr ibutable to non-controlling interests, net of tax i n our 
consolidated statements of operations. 
On October 6, 2023, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor exercised their right to require that either Freight Holding conduct an IPO 
or we redeem them at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, described above.
