Driver and Courier Well-Being 
In addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, 
Merchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. 
In relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, 
providing accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its 
apps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , 
traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can 
and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, 
retention and satisfaction rates.
