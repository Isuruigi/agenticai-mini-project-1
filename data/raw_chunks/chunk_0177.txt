dollars. Furthermore, such business practice s may also result in negative press coverage, which 
may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely af fect our revenue. In addition, we face 
regulatory obstacles, includi ng those lobbied for by our compe titors or from local governments gl obally, that have favored and may 
continue to favor local or incumbent co mpetitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses  or 
vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of m unicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respec t to our 
Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our M obility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will co ntinue 
to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To t he extent 
that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other  
requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected. 
Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future 
prospects.
