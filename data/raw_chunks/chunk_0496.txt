rities claimed the payment of social security contributions since the launch of Uber Eats. We re ached a 
settlement with the Canton of Geneva on Mobility with regards to social security implications. 
The ultimate resolution of the matt ers before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those mat ters 
is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. 
Other Driver Classification Matters 
Additionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions , and anticipate future claims, 
lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and gove rnment investigations and audits challenging our classificat ion of 
Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is 
supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vi gorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation  and 
arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could  have a 
material impact on our business, financia l condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigati on and 
arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the 
aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.
