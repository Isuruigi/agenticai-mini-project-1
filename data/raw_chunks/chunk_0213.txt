h could r equire us 
to pay out material amounts that  may be in excess of our insu rance reserves, including as a re sult of adverse legal proceedings , 
resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance rese rves include amounts for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expe nses 
for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based o n 
actuarial estimates, historical claim inform ation, and industry data. While management  believes that these reserve amounts are 
adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our rese rves. Insurance recoverables are recognized when we enter into contracts 
that transfer the risk recorded in our insurance reserves to th ird-party insurance companies. We  also have requirements to post  
collateral for current and future claim sett lement obligations with certain of our in surance carriers, which may have a signifi cant 
impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes. 
We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traf fic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have 
been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Driv ers are not actively using our pl atform or when an individual 
impersonates a Driver, by consumers using our services, or by thir d parties.
