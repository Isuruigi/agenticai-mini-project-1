in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all . 
Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expe ct to achieve as a result of our prior or future acquisition s. Even if 
we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term. 
If we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a 
result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be 
adversely impacted. 
Our success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in tha t 
geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to  offer 
their services through our platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We 
have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate.  To 
the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce  the 
Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market.
