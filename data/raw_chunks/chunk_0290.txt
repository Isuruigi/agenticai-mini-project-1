is  a key measure used  by our management 
team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future ope rating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those rela ting to 
operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBIT DA provides useful information to investors and others in 
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the sa me manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it 
provides a useful measure for period-to-per iod comparisons of our business, as it re moves the effect of certain non-cash expens es and 
certain variable charges. 
Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements 
Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or 
governmental investigations  related to worker cla ssification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positi ons. 
These matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore 
are distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulator y matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating 
performance.
 
Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation 
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be  considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a 
substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
