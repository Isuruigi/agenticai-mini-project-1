ver operations, platform user support representatives and  
community managers. Also included is the cost of customer s upport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate 
costs. 
We would expect operations and support expenses to vary from pe riod to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a 
percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users. 
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses primarily cons ist of advertising costs, product marketi ng costs, consumer discounts, promotions, 
credits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customer s, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sale s 
and marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as 
incurred. 
We would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from pe riod to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of 
marketing campaigns. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a busin ess model change in certain major markets resulting in end-
users becoming our customers. Promotions to end-users consider ed customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to  
end-users not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses.
