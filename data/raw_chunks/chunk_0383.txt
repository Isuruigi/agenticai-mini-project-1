nt related services. Our sole performance 
obligation in these contracts is the integr ation of these services that allow for th e transport of the Shipper’s freight by ind ependent 
freight carriers. Transportation Ma nagement revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the amount of gross fees charged to Shipp ers 
upon satisfaction of our performance obligation. Costs incurred w ith independent freight carriers for these transactions are re corded in 
cost of revenue. Revenue is recognized as our performance obliga tion is satisfied, which generally represents the transit perio d from 
origin to destination by an independent freight carrier. While th e transit period of our contract s can vary based on origin and  
destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not ma terial. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon 
completion of our performance obligation. 
Principal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations 
Judgment is required in determining whether we recognize the fees  charged to Shippers on a gross or net basis. We record the 
majority of our revenue from Brokerage a nd Transportation Management on a gross basis at the amounts charged to Shippers as we 
are primarily responsible for facilitating the transportation of Shippers’ goods with independent freight carriers that meet the Shipper’s 
specifications. We also have pricing discretion for the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to Carriers.
