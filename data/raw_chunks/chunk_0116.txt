to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and featur es that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shipper s, and 
Carriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors. For example, in January 2020, we  introduced a number of product change s in 
California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected 
fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthe n the 
independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. 
Developing and delivering new or upgraded pr oducts, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, 
offerings, and features depends on several factors, including th e timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of suc h 
products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, or features may not work as intended  or 
may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may 
continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced suppl y of Drivers on our platform, Dr iver dissatisfaction, and adve rse

impacts on the operation of our platform.
