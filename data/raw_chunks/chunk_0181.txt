in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on behalf of partic ipants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle ind ustry who 
were licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The clas s 
action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions duri ng such periods. The court approved the class action settlement with no 
admission of liability by Uber. In September 2024, a constitutiona l reform to the judiciary in Mexico was approved; secondary 
regulations are still pending, which are needed to assess the legal impact on our operations in Mexico. These legislative and regulatory 
proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could resu lt in 
financial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, in carceration, and sanctions for i ndividuals employed by us or pa rties 
with whom we contract, which could harm our  ability to operate our business as planned in  one or more of the jurisdictions in w hich 
we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results.
