In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among ot her things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combi nations 
we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit

pricing models.

which we operate.
