nvestee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis 
differences. In accounting for these investment s, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrear s. Equity 
method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in f
air value 
reflected in earnings. 
We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.  Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of  a 
potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the inv estee’s 
securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our in tention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an i mpairment 
is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairme nt 
charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determinatio n, 
particularly for investments in privately held companies, requi res significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and 
assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affe ct the calculation of the fair value of the investments and t he 
determination of the impairment charges.
