Drivers may become subject to in creased licensing requirements, and we may be re quired to obtain additional licenses or cap the  
number of Drivers using our platform. 
Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial ta xi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. Howeve r, 
numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including 
markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and 
Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be  licensed with local authorities or require us or our 
subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect 
our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of 
licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or im pose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, 
similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and Ne w York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for 
Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness 
and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.
