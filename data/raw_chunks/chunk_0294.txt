Operating Activities 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024,  primarily consisting of $9.8 
billion of net income including non-controlling interests, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $6.0 b illion of 
deferred income taxes, $1.8 billion of stoc k-based compensation expense, $1.8 billion of  unrealized gains from equity securities, $737 
million of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as a $2.4 billion increa se in cash from working capital. The increase in cash 
from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves primarily due to liabilities recorded during 
the period exceeding claims paid out, and accrued expenses and ot her liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts r eceivable 
and prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to tax matter s recorded as a receivable in other assets described in the No n-
Income Tax Matters section below.
