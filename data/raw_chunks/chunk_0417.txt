unobservable inputs in is olation, such as the security price in a signifi cant financing 
transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase  or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, 
including short-term revenue projections, time  to liquidity, and volatility are less se nsitive to the valuation in the respecti ve reporting 
periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s  financing transactions. In th e future, depending on the weight of 
evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value. 
We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.
