Advertising Revenue 
We derive the majority of our advertisi ng revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for 
advertising on our platform. Adve rtising revenue is recognized when an end-user  engages with the sponsored listing based on the  
number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in  the amount billed to Merchants and brands as we control the advertisement 
before it is transferred to the end-user.  
Incentives to Customers  
Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cann ot 
reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received . Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange f or a 
distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the  time or 
as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incen tive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, t here is 
limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration. 
Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid  in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as  
customer acquisition costs.
