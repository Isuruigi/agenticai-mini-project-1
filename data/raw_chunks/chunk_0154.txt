ware may also presen t additional security risks because the public availabi lity of such software may mak e it 
easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software sour ce 
code that we make available under an open source license or th at we contribute to existing ope n source projects becomes publicl y 
available, our ability to protect our intell ectual property rights in such software s ource code may be limited or lost entirely , and we 
would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be 
harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating result s and could help our competitor s develop products and offering s that 
are similar to or better than ours.

To continue to effectively compete, we w ill require additional funds to support the gr owth of our business and allow us to inve st 
in new products, offerings, and mark ets. If we raise additional f unds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, 
our existing stockholders may suffer signifi cant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences,  and 
privileges superior to those of existing st ockholders.
