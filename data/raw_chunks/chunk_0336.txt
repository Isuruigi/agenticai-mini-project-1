Valuation of Insurance Reserves 
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements , insurance reserves is an estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and 
loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for ce rtain insurance related risks, including 
auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical  damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation, and in cludes 
an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance she et date. 
The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted  actuarial methods applied to historical  claim and lo ss 
experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and 
expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continual ly 
reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops a nd new information becomes known. The Company’s short-term and 
long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2024 totaled $9.8 billion.
