Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option fo r many workers historically marg inalized from the labor market 
and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service of ferings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that m ore 
can be done to improve the experi ence of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across 
countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent  workers are generally patchy compared with those that employ ees 
receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an 
employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independe nt worker who has access to relatively few. This does not h ave to 
be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not  have to come at the expense of security and dignity in wor k. 
Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues. 
• Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 
social safety net.
