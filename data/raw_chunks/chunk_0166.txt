ly identify, acquire and integrat e suitable businesses, our operati ng results and prospects could  be 
harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated. 
As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect  to continue to enter into, ag reements to acquire companies, 
form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business,  sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, a nd acquire 
complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is 
intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target fo r acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on 
commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive a pproval from the applicable comp etition authorities, or such targ et 
may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.  
Further, negotiations for potentia l acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and  
significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and suc h 
indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to  make interest and principal payments.
