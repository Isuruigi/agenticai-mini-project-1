domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secr ets may be compromised by third 
parties or our employees, which would cause  us to lose the competitive advantage de rived from the compromi sed trade secrets. 
Further, we may be unable to detect infringe ment of our intellectual prope rty rights, and even if we detect such violations and  decide 
to enforce our intellectual prope rty rights, we may not be successful, and may in cur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, 
any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may 
result in a ruling that our intellectual pr operty rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of ou r intellectual 
property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating 
results.
