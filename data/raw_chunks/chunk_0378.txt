Principal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations 
Judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or  agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users . 
We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-use r and 
are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arra nge for other parties to provide the servi ce to the end-user and are an agent (i.e.  “net”).
