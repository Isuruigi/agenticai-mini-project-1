Our platform provides offerings in the mob ility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the mark ets 
in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mob ility and delivery industries glob ally 
and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada fro m existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and i n the 
future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers  to entry that characterize these industrie s. In 
addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-
cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the plat form with the highest earnings potential; resta urants and 
other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platfo rm that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and othe r goods 
and provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity  to shift to the platform with the best price and 
most convenient service for hauling shipments. 
Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new pr oducts and offerings across a range  of industries, many of our 
competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialize d 
expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.
