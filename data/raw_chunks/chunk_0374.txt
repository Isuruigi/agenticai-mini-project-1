s the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group  to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount 
by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. 
Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 
Fair value is defined as the price that woul d be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability in an orderly transa ction 
between market participants at the measurement date. In accord ance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the 
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hi erarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority 
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable input s. The three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:  
Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
87 
Level 2 Observable inputs other th an Level 1 prices such as quoted  prices for similar assets or  liabilities in active markets, 
quoted prices in markets that are not ac tive or inputs other than the quoted prices  that are observable either directly 
or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or 
liabilities.
