Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in  which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions 
have different statutory tax rates than those in the United Stat es. Additionally, certain of our fo reign earnings may also be t axable in 
the United States. Acco rdingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative pr oportion of foreign to domestic in come, 
changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. 
The income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the 
release of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits 
and other non-material deferred tax assets.  
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider 
both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight 
of all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
