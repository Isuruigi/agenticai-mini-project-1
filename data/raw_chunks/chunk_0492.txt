The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supr eme Court in Dynamex Operations v. 
Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test , workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the  
hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity ’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the 
usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the indepe ndent trade, work or type of business pe rformed

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorn eys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San 
Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers ar e 
misclassified, and seeks an injunction a nd monetary damages related to the allege d competitive advantage caused by the alleged 
misclassification of drivers. 
On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classi fying drivers as independent 
contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the 
Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the deci sion with the California Supre me 
Court.
