, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAA P 
financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe 
that these non-GAAP financial me asures provide meaningful supp lemental informatio n regarding our performance by excluding 
certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. 
We believe that both management  and investors benefit from re ferring to these non-GAAP financ ial measures in assessing our 
performance and when planning, fo recasting, and analyzing future  periods. These non-GAAP financia l measures also facilitate 
management’s internal co mparisons to our historic al performance. We believe these non-GAAP  financial measures are useful to 
investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and 
operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institu tional investors and the analyst co mmunity to help them analyze  the 
health of our business. Accordingly, we be lieve that these non-GAAP financial measures prov ide useful information to investors and 
others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in th e same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our 
calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ  from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our pe er 
companies.
