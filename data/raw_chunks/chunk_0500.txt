Non-Income Tax Matters 
We recorded an estim ated liability for cont ingencies related to non-income tax matt ers and are under aud it by various domestic 
and foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters.  
The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-incom e tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax 
purposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the application of certain employee benefits and employment and income taxes 
to our Drivers and Couriers. In jurisdictions with disputes conn ected to transactions on the platform, disputes involve the applicability 
of transactional taxes (such as sales tax, V AT, GST and similar taxes) or gross receipts taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected 
to employment or income taxes, disputes involve the applicabil ity of withholding taxes related to employment taxes or back-up 
income tax withholding on payments made to Drivers, Couriers, and Merchants. 
Our estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial proces ses in 
certain jurisdictions; therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.
