2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Marketab le debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments 
totaled $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securiti es 
primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. gove rnment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and 
investment-grade corporate debt securities . We do not enter into investments for tr ading or speculative purposes. Investments i n fixed 
rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in  rates would primarily impact in terest income due to the relati vely short-
term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point ch ange in interest rates would not have a material effect on our  
financial results. 
We are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, 
privately-held entities and public  companies, compared to  their fair value. We hold privat ely held investments in illiquid priv ate 
company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the la ck of publicly available information. We also hold equity sec urities 
with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.
