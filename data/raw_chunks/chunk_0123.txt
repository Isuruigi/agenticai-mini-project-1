tion of consis tent data security measures. Our failure to  comply with the Standard and other netw ork 
operating rules could result in fines or re strictions on our ability to accept paymen t cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the 
payment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments , or other assessments of our 
compliance with the Standard. Such  activities may reveal that we have failed to  comply with the Standa rd. If an audit, self- 
assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any de ficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our 
management team and require us to undertake costly and time  consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the 
Standard, there is no assurance that we will  be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could ado pt 
new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our pr ocessors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or  costly to 
implement. In addition to violations of network rules, including  the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the 
payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our 
business.
