Lyft, Inc., alle ging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an 
injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitiv e advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers . To 
comply with Proposition 22, we ha ve incurred and expect to incu r additional expenses , including expenses associated with a 
guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for inju ry protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these 
changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classi fy Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employ ees 
where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additiona l expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associa ted 
with the application of wage and hour laws  (including minimum wage, ove rtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee 
benefits, social security contributions, ta xes (direct and indirect), and potential pe nalties. Additionally, we may not have ad equate 
Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able 
to hire a majority of the Driv ers currently using our platform. Any of these ev ents could negatively impact our business, resul ts of 
operations, financial position, and cash flows.
