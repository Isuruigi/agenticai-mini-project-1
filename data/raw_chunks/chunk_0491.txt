eral Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative a nd audit proceedings, asserting cla ims by 
or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are mi sclassified as independent contractors. In  connection with the enactment of Californ ia State 
Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue  to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an inc reased 
number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledg e, we 
believe that the ultimate amount or range of  reasonably possible loss will not, either i ndividually or in the aggregate, have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of opera tions, or cash flows. The outco me of such legal matters is inherently 
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of 
management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

California Attorney General Lawsuit 
In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to  determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. 
The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supr eme Court in Dynamex Operations v. 
Superior Court in 2018.
