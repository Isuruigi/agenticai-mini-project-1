incident, see the risk factor titled “—We face risks related to  our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing  of data, 
which could result in investigations, inqui ries, litigation, fines, legislative, a nd regulatory action, and negative press abou t our privacy 
and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operati ons, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the 
companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly  disclosed and notified relevant  regulatory authorities that i t had 
been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to  certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platf orm, as of 
January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result  of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to  remediate 
this or any other data security incident that Careem or we e xperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and 
significant liabilities. If we fail to remediate any other data secur ity incident that we experience, we may face harm to our b rand, 
business disruption, and significant liabilities . Security and privacy incidents have le d to, and may continue to lead to, addi tional 
regulatory scrutiny.
