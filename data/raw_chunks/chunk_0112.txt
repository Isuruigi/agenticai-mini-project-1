Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, phishing 
and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results. 
We rely heavily on information technology systems across our ope rations. Our information technology systems, including mobile 
and online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal 
and external communications, and the information technology system s of our third-party business partners and service providers,  
contain proprietary or confidential inform ation related to business and personal data, including se nsitive personal data, entrusted to us 
by platform users, employees, and job candidates, and make us a ta rget for threat actors. Cyberattacks that leverage computer 
malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account  takeovers, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have bec ome 
more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constant ly 
evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques.
