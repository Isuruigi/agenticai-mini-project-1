r misconduct. These faciliti es may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power  loss, 
telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes , tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide 
complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a resu lt, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-p arty 
service providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in o ur 
inability to serve data reliably  or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing se rvice. 
This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which coul d significantly interrupt the provision of 
our products and offerings and harm our reput ation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data cent er 
provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the se rvices we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center  providers 
are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data  center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our c o-located 
data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
