Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
Accounts receivable represents: (i) uncollected payments from e nd-users for completed transactions where the payment method is 
credit card and includes (a) end-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers and (b) end-user payments settled  by 
payment service providers but not yet remitted to us; (ii) co mpleted shipments where we have an unconditional right to the 
consideration from Freight customers (“Shippers”) and payment has not been received; or (iii) uncollected payments from Uber fo r 
Business organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by 
product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabili ties on 
the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 9 – Supplementa l Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and 
Merchants. 
Although we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposur e, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We 
record an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card 
chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.
