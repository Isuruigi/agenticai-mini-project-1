which could harm our  ability to operate our business as planned in  one or more of the jurisdictions in w hich 
we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. 
In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers in  
certain cities continue to have access to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to 
subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to  our other Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example,  
consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe  level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced w hile 
riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some  cases absent, passive protecti on systems on dockless e-bikes and  e-
scooters. The occurrence of real or percei ved quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-s cooters 
available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or l awsuits 
filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured. 
Changes in, or failure to comply with, co mpetition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating 
results. 
Competition authorities closely sc rutinize us under U.S. and fo reign antitrust and competition laws.
