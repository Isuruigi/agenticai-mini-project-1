Other jurisdictions outside the EU are simi larly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulation s, 
including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase  our compliance costs and the risks asso ciated 
with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provided new privacy rights for  
38 
consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages 
framework and private rights of action against businesses that fa il to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable 
security procedures and pr actices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar 
laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed 
the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws 
may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California 
Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in Cali fornia in November 2020.
