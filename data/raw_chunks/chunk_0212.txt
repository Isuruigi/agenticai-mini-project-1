providers, and should such providers discontinue  or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to  
secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other 
automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corpor ate 
risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, a nd director and officers’ liability. If o ur insurance 
carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cos t of 
insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in th e United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, i f the 
insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs. 
In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that 
transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance pr ovider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could r equire us 
to pay out material amounts that  may be in excess of our insu rance reserves, including as a re sult of adverse legal proceedings , 
resulting in harm to our financial condition.
