third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, al teration, or 
destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. 
This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations 
domestically and internationally, we have been, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose 
substantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effecti ve in 
May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent  requirements for controllers and processors of personal dat a. 
Such requirements include higher consent standards to process pe rsonal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal d ata, 
strengthened individual data rights, data br each requirements, limitations on data re tention, strengthened requirements for spe cial 
categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers 
that may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subj ect to a 
decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,  which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly 
significantly affects them.
