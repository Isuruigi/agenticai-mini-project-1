igh-quality support, or if we  cannot otherwise attract and retain a la rge number of Drivers, consumers, mer chants, 
Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer. 
The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including 
Drivers ceasing to provide thei r services through our platform, passage or enforcement of loca l laws limiting our products and 
offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or  services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing 
models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. W hile we 
aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that availabl e in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar  work, 
we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to r educe 
Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase. 
Often, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of  various platform users, as a change that one category of use rs 
views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another cate gory of users.
