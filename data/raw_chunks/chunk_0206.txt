become burdensome. Further, the use of arb itration provisions may subject us to certain  risks to our reputation and brand, as t hese 
provisions have been the subject of increasi ng public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the fut ure 
voluntarily limit our use of arbitr ation provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, eit her of 
which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended 
mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees. 
Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceabili ty of arbitration on a state-by-state bas is, as 
well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or  all of our arbitration provisions  could be subject to challeng e or may 
need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection.  If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in  whole 
or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and 
the time involved in resolving such disput es, and we could face increased exposure to  potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.
