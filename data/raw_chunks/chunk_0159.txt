ax in multiple U.S. and  foreign 
jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investi gating our 
compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes. 
Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed 
taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the appli cability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could 
materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referr ed to as 
“pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such paymen ts 
are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, 
the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. 
Additionally, the taxing authorities of the ju risdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or 
challenge our methodologies for valuing deve loped technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ou r 
financial position and operating results.
