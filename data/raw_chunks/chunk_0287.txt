Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

to revenue, net income (loss), income (los s) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue 
growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAA P 
financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.
