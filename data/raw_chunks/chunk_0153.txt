tware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-complianc e with the applicable terms of such license, including claims fo r 
infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-sour ce 
software license types, almost none of which have been tested in  a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding th e proper 
legal interpretation of such licenses. If we  were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source  
licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions  of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and  
resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. 
In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial 
software because open-source licensors generally do not provide wa rranties or controls on the func tionality or origin of the so ftware. 
Use of open source software may also presen t additional security risks because the public availabi lity of such software may mak e it 
easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform.
