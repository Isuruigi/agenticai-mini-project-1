competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialize d 
expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.  As we and our competitors  introduce new products and 
offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors  may 
adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers valu e more 
highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to diff erentiate our products. Increase d 
competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the numbe r of 
platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins. 
We face competition in each of our offerings, including: 
• Mobility. Our Mobility offering compet es with personal vehicle ow nership and usage, which a ccounts for the majority of 
passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditio nal transportation services, including taxicab companies and 
taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,  public transportation can be a superior substitute to our 
Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower- cost travel option in many cities.
