Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people are able to achieve their 
highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in  establishing the culture we need through employee engagement 
surveys and related tools. We conduct continuous listening by colle cting feedback from employees throughout the year and throug h 
various channels. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on t opics 
such as well-being, fairness, re wards and recognition, and growth  opportunities. For example, our  hybrid work approach was shap ed 
based on employee feedback.
