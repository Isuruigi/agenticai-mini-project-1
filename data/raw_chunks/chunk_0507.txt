Unconsolidated VIEs 
We do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the entiti es’ economic performance. We are exposed to these unconsolidated  VIEs’ 
economic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial guarantees, which re present 
variable interests. Our carrying amounts of both assets and liabilities recognized on the conso lidated balance sheets related t o 
unconsolidated VIEs noted belo w were $575 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
