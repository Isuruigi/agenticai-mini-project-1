to use these credits in future periods. 
Furthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will 
not be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against th ese net deferred tax assets. We regularly  review 
the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected ti ming of 
the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. 
Based on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have 
sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. H owever, 
our judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to 
many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our bus iness plans and/or tax planning  
strategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in th e recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated b alance 
sheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.
