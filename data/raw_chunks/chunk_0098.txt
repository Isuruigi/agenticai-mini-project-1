nounced over 
time as our growth slows. Other seasonal tr ends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which 
would contribute to fluctuations in our op erating results. In addition to seasonality , our operating results may fluctuate as a  result of 
factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform us ers, increased competition in the markets in which we operat e, our 
ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ab ility to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively m anage 
that growth, our ability to k eep pace with technological change s in the industries in which we  operate, changes in governmental  or 
other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on 
estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quick ly 
enough if our revenue is  less than expected, resulting in lo sses that exceed our expectations . If we are unable to achieve sust ained 
profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.
