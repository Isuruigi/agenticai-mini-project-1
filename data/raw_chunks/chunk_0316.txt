Income Taxes 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and forei gn jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and 
liability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management  to make 
significant estimates and assumptions to dete rmine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing i ntangible 
assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intan gible 
assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. Th e discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to  present 
value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. 
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical 
experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occu r 
that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. 
We account for uncertainty in tax positions  by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-th an-
not that the position will be sustained upon examination.
