Our Segments 
As of December 31, 2024, we had three operating and reportab le segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery 
and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.
 
Mobility 
Our Mobility offering connects consumers with  a wide range of transpor tation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, 
micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more—helping cu stomers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global 
leadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data that  comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and 
data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.  
We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities.
