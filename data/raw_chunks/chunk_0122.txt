greements or if our collecti on systems fail, we may be adve rsely affected by both the inability  to collect amounts due and the  cost of 
enforcing the terms of our cont racts, including litigation.  Such collection failure and enfor cement costs, along with any costs  
associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance. 
Loss or material modification of our credit  card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operati ng 
results. 
In 2024, 62% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptan ce 
privileges would significantly limit our business model. We are re quired by our payment processors to comply with payment card 
network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a 
comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account da ta security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council t o

help facilitate the broad adoption of consis tent data security measures. Our failure to  comply with the Standard and other netw ork 
operating rules could result in fines or re strictions on our ability to accept paymen t cards.
