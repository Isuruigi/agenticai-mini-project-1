Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significan t unobservable inputs or data in inactive 
markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of ma rket prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified  as 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimate d fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we  utilize 
the most recent data available including observed transactions such  as equity financing transacti ons of the investees and sales  of the 
existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the de termination of whether an observed transaction is similar to t he equity 
and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. 
We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securitie s quarterly for impairment. The impairment analys is 
for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative anal ysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance,  industry 
and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity i nvestment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new  
carrying value for the investment and rec ognize an impairment loss through our conso lidated statement of operations.
