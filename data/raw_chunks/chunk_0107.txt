uccessfully transition into new roles, fo r example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attriti on, could 
have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key pers onnel 
and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect sm ooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future hav e an 
adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industr y 
experience. If we cannot effectivel y manage leadership transitions  and management changes in th e future, our reputation and fut ure 
business prospects could be adversely affected. 
To attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to 
attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our busines s effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, 
retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase 
commensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain hig h-quality 
management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results  could be adversely affected.
