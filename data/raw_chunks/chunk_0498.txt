California Employment Development Department 
In 2014, the California employment development department (“CA  EDD”) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be 
treated as employees or independent contra ctors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and  we 
have since reached an agreement with the CA EDD for this period. In 2022, we received requests for information related to an au dit of 
a subsequent period, which covers the fourth  quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit  for 
the years 2018 - 2020 covering courie rs who used the Postmates plat form and received an assessment in June 2023. We are in the 
process of appealing the assessment. The ultimate re solution of the matter is  uncertain and the amount accrued for those matter s is 
recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
