l estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserv es, are subject to inherent 
variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement  process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited  historical 
experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resu lts depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be 
affected by many factors, such as claim se ttlement processes and changes in the econom ic, legal, and social environments. As a result, 
the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from 
the estimated amounts. 
While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less th an, 
the amount provided.
