Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders 
We compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class me thod required for participating securities. The two-class method 
requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securiti es 
based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.  
Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early  exercise of stock options are participating securities. We 
consider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating 
securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a ca sh dividend is declared on comm on 
stock.
