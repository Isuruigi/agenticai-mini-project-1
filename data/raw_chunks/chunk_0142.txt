services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs 
on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause or der volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations  
altogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreas ed 
supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which coul d 
harm our business and operating results.
