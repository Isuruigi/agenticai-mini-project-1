arrying valu e of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the 
consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to  the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of  a 
loss in value might include, but would not n ecessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of t he 
investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investmen t. This 
evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; 
implied values in recent transactions of investee securities ; other publicly availabl e information that may affect the value of  our 
investments. 
Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment 
We evaluate our held-and-used long-lived as sets for indicators of  possible impairment when events  or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectiv ely, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure th e 
recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows i t 
expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group  to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount 
by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.
