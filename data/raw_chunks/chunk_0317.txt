We account for uncertainty in tax positions  by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-th an-
not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain ta x positions and dete rmining our provision for 
income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judg ments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have 
adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will  not be 
different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the 
final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amount s recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income  taxes 
and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. 
The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net int erest 
and penalties. In addition, we ar e subject to the continuous exam ination of our income tax retu rns by the IRS and other tax aut horities 
which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinatio ns 
and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
