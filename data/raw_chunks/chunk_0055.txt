vices, Driver incentiv es, consumer discounts and 
promotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pric ing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than t hose 
that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater reso urces and 
access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier  bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our comp etitors 
in certain geographic markets en joy substantial competitive adva ntages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating hist ories, 
larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more s upportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may  be  
13 
able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing oppor tunities, technologies, consumer 
preferences, regulations, or standards, wh ich may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competi tors may 
share in the eff ective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without hav ing to 
incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.
