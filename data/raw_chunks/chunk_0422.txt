Didi Investment 
In the second quarter of 2022, Didi co mpleted their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE Delisting”). We 
concluded the ordinary sh ares held by us did not have a readily determinable fair va lue and should be accounted for under the 
measurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, Didi American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) continue to be 
traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary shares held prior t o the 
NYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value ba sed on the closing share price of the Didi ADS on the OTC marke t 
on December 31, 2023 and 2024  as an observable transaction fo r similar securities.
