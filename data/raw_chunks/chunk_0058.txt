of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times 
meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we d o 
not have a leading category position, which ma y result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and 
consumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering suc h 
Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and 
reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected , and will continue to negativ ely affect, our financial perform ance. 
Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will 
likely in the future be modified, and pric ing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our prici ng 
models or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers a nd Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to  the 
information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer st ructure changes, adversely impacted usage of th e 
application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adve rsely 
impacted.
