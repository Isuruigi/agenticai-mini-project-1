cord stock-based compensation expense for service-based stoc k options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-
line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. 
For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only, th e valuation model, typically th e Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model, incorporates various assumptions in cluding expected stock price volatility, expect ed term and risk-free interest rates. We 
estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant ba sed on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own 
shares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury  yield 
curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplif ied 
method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not 
provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for non-employees’ options based 
on the contractual term. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as  we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our 
common stock.
