Our growing use of artificial intelligence an d machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with 
algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment. 
Our growing use of artificial intelligence  (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our business and offerings presents additiona l 
risks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated decision-making or processing of data 
may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain ina ccurate or biased information, which can create inaccurate or 
discriminatory outcomes. AI tool s and algorithms may use third-party AI with unc lear intellectual prope rty rights or interests.  
Intellectual property ownership and license  rights, including copyright, of generativ e and other AI output, have not been fully  
interpreted by courts or regulations. Europe , the United States and other countries ar e enacting or may consider comprehensive legal 
compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that European lawmakers have passed the first  
such framework, the European Artificial In telligence Act (“AI Act”), which came into effect in August 2024.
