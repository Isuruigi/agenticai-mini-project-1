performance and prospects would be adversely impacted. 
Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and lia bilities. Collisions, including fatal collis ions, have happene d. 
Failures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or cras hes involving autonomou s vehicles using th e 
technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability  for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regul atory 
scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results. 
Federal and state government regulations specifically desi gned to govern autonomous vehicl e operation, testing and/or 
manufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous ve hicles 
on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our 
platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or  parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicle techno logies 
are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws a pplicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could beco me 
subject to substantial fines or penalties. 
Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several 
reductions in workforce.
