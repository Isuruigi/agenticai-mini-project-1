may require incurri ng substantial costs and may not be successful,  due to, 
among other things, the uncertainty  associated with the longer-term projections associated with managi ng climate risks. Additionally, 
we are or may become subject to emerging environmental and social laws and regulations, including climate policies such as 
California’s climate-related disclosure legislation (SB 219) a nd regulations adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of  
vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have  been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets b eginning 
in 2023. Certain jurisdictions have also de veloped and implemented rules to address th e environmental impact of rideshare, and 
additional jurisdictions may consider simila r rules and regulations. We are also subjec t to the Corporate Sustainability Report ing 
Directive, which was adopted in the European Union in December 2022. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related 
policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Conge stion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in  
London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, wh ich may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on o ur 
platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.
