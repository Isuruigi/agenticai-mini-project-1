, third-party services and products are constantly  evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure 
its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes.  The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of 
third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business. 
We rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing  infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party 
elements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected. 
The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. 
We rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to comp lete consumer transactions and remit paym ents 
to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and thes e third parties may refuse to re new our agreements with them on  
commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies beco me unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on accep table 
terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain paym ent methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay  
interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs.
