interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public aw areness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputat ion 
could have an amplified effect on our va rious platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned compani es, 
including Careem, Postmates and Corn ershop, have or will continue to  use their own brands  and/or operate their own apps in para llel 
with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation. 
Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in 
connection with certain divestitures and join t ventures, including to Yandex in Russia/CI S, and while we have certain contractu al 
protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to 
anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that th ese service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if  Drivers, 
merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, ar e involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in 
malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unf avorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be 
harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions  that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequent ly, our 
business.
