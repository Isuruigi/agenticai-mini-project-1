platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our pl atform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the 
classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furtherm ore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolvin g pending 
and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to  be 
material to our business. 
In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who ha ve entered into arbitration agre ements with us have filed (or  
expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us th at assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the 
classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous 
legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agre ements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in  such 
proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an 
adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.
