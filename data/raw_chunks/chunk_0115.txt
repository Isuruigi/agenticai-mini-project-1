cyberattacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the pe rformance, reliability, security, and availability of our produ cts, 
offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of pl atform users, shareholders and certain regulators would likely  harm our 
reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, di sruption to our business, and o ur 
decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. 
If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, 
Shippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such us ers to our platform and our operating results would be adverse ly 
affected. 
To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchant s, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to contin ue 
to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and featur es that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shipper s, and 
Carriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors.
