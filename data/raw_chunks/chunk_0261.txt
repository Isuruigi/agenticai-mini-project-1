51 
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization 
Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Deli very 
transactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility a nd Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, c ertain 
insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation se rvices, 
credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networki ng expenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts relat ed to 
fare chargebacks and other credit card losses. 
We expect that cost of revenue, exclusiv e of depreciation and amortization, will fluc tuate on an absolute dollar basis for the 
foreseeable future primarily driven by Trip volume changes on the platform.

that support operations in cities, including the general managers , Driver operations, platform user support representatives and  
community managers. Also included is the cost of customer s upport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate
