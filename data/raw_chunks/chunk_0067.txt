orced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of  various platform users, as a change that one category of use rs 
views as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another cate gory of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, 
help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with lo w ratings 
or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Dr ivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with  
15 
platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which 
may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissat isfaction has in the past resu lted in 
protests by Drivers in various regions, incl uding India, the United Kingdom, and the Un ited States. Such protests have resulted , and 
any future protests may result, in interruptions to our business.  Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline  in our 
number of platform users, which would reduc e our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform u sage. 
Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shi ppers, or Carriers using our plat form would reduce the value of our 
network and would harm our future operating results.
