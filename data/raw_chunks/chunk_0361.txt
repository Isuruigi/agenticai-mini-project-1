Leases 
We account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standard s Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We made a 
policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease 
components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. 
We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement base d on whether we have the right to obtain 
substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an id entified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an 
identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets repr esent 
our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from 
the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the 
present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present valu e of the 
future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is no t readily 
determinable.
