countries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a si milar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduc t 
Authority, as does UBR Pagos México, S.A. de C.V ., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico, issued by the Comisión Nacional 
Bancaria y de Valores in Mexico. We continue to critically ev aluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals i n 
several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied  such 
licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our busin ess operations before being gr anted 
such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licen ses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease o r limit  
36 
business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could b e subject 
to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such license s, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some 
countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that 
such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators ma y block payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers.
