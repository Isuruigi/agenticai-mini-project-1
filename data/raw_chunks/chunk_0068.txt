form u sage. 
Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shi ppers, or Carriers using our plat form would reduce the value of our 
network and would harm our future operating results. 
In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check  requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to  
onboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process vari es by jurisdiction, and t here 
have been allegations, including from regulat ors, legislators, prosecuto rs, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check 
process is insufficient or inadequate. With  respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our 
qualification and background check standards are generally less ex tensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to pr ovide 
rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and re gulators may pass laws or  adopt regulations in the future requiring Driv ers to 
undergo a materially different type of qua lification, screening, or background check process, or  that limit our  ability to acce ss 
information used in the background check process in an efficien t manner, which could be costly and time-consuming.
