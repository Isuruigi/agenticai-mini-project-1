quired a remeasurement of a prio r year transfer pricing tax position 
resulting in an overall reduction in our net deferred tax assets  of $1.2 billion, which is full y offset by a change in the 
valuation allowance. This is reflected in the increases to prior year uncertain tax positions above. 
 As of December 31, 2024, approximately $421 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax 
rate. The remaining $4.5 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance 
against certain deferred tax assets.  
We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecogni zed tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the 
consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount of interest and penalties accrued was $17 
million and $17 million, respectively.
 
 Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to 
estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. An estimate of changes to 
unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December 31, 2024 , that are reasonably possible to o ccur within the next 12 months can not 
be made. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign 
income tax examinations.
