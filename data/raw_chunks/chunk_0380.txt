te a trip via the Platform, amounts charged to end-users for Mobility services, and fees charged to end-
users for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.  
Depending on the market where the trip is comp leted, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the 
difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount  earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference 
between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesha ring 
services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance fo r the ridesharing services provided. We typically receive the service 
fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip. 
In certain markets, end-users have the option to pay cash for trips. Service fees for cash trips are recognized only when colle cted 
from Drivers as we concluded that collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. 
Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products. 
Delivery 
We derive our Delivery revenue from service fees paid by Couriers  and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to 
successfully complete meal preparation, grocery and other delivery service on the platform, amounts charged to end-users for Delivery 
services, and fees charged to end-users for use of the platform in certain markets.
