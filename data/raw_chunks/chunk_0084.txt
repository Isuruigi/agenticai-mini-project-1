t could be relevant to a determinatio n of 
eligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for 
Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not in dependently test Drivers’ driving skills. Cons equently, we expect to continue to rec eive 
complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or  threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have 
also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualifica tion processes and background checks, and general 
misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform. 
If Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impe rsonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropr iate 
conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offeri ngs 
safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which wo uld 
adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have  been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or 
individuals impersonating Drivers,  sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuri ng consumers, or otherwise eng aging 
in criminal activity while using our platfo rm or claiming to use our platform.
