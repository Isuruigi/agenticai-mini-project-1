ion that platform users share with us is vital to our business. One key way that 
Uber addresses this need is through its cybersecurity program, which includes a cybersecurity risk management program. 
Uber’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is respons ible for the cybersecurity program, which is coordinated and 
primarily executed by the global organization of engineers focu sed on risk management using the NIST Framework (Govern, Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and activities such as automation, secure development, and advanced analytics and 
monitoring. The CISO has served in such role since February 202 1 and has more than 20+ years of  engineering and/or cybersecurit y 
experience, including previously as CISO and Deputy Chief Technology Officer at a Fortune 500 company. 
The cybersecurity program is also supported by Uber’s Chie f Privacy Officer and Associate General Counsel, Privacy & 
Cybersecurity (“CPO”), who has served in that role since August 2018. The CPO has over three decades of experience as a legal 
advisor to multinational corporat ions, including serving as Chief Privacy & Security Counsel fo r a Fortune 100 technology compa ny 
prior to her role at Uber. 
The cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal 
Officer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer.
