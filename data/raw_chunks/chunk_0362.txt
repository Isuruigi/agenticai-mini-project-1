te used to determine the present valu e of the 
future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is no t readily 
determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our unders tanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and result ing 
interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease pa yments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a 
collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are 
included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utiliti es, real 
estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those 
payments are incurred. 
Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-
current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current 
liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.
