Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business 
Operational Risks 
Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees. 
The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United 
States and abroad. We are involved in nu merous legal proceedings gl obally, including putative class and collective class action  
lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before admi nistrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, so cial 
security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be  treated as our employees (or as  workers or quasi-employees where those 
statuses exist), rather than as independe nt contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among oth er 
things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ 
platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our pl atform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the 
classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.
