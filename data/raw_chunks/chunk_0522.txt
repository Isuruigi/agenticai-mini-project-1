Chief Financial Offi cer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this  Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024  
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Fi nancial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and 
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are de signed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their object ives and 
are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our mana gement does not expect that our disclosure controls and proce dures 
or our internal control over financial re porting will prevent or detect all error a nd fraud. Any control system, no matter how well  
129 
designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not abso lute, assurance that its obje ctives 
will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or 
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
