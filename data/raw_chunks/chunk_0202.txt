n policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us 
in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse im pact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has histo rically 
shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global po licies regarding data use, shar ing, and 
ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, an d 
doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in  certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such gove rnment 
authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if  any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or 
regulations relating to data residency or local computation such th at we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk 
losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could a dversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and  
offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results. 
Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapi dly evolving, making implementation 
and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, un certain, and potentially inconsistent.
