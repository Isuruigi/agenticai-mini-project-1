ducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant 
or such laws and regulations are determined  to be invalid or inapplicable. For exam ple, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of 
Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used th e Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hi re Car 
Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. A judici al review process is pending. Ho wever, these developments may 
adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As ano ther 
example, in January 2020, we ceased offering  our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local 
competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made  certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched 
Mobility in Colombia in Februa ry 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to  block Mobility produc ts 
in Colombia. Such decision was confirmed by the Colombia Supreme Court in 2023. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions,  we 
continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and 
offerings or while we seek judicial, regulat ory or policy changes to address concerns w ith respect to our ab ility to comply wit h these 
laws and regulations.
