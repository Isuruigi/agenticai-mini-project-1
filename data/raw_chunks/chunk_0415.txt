Fair Value Hierarchy 
We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value. Level 1 inst rument valuations are based on quoted market  
prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for 
comparable instruments, identical instrument s in less active markets, or models usi ng market observable inputs. Level 3 instrum ent 
valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estim ation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, 
inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Le vel 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receiv able from a related party 
primarily consist of common stock investments and convertible secu red notes that may be converted into common or preferred stoc k 
in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. 
Depending on the investee’s financ ing activity in a reporting period, management’s  estimate of fair value may be primarily 
derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the i ssuance of preferred stock to ne w investors. The price in thes e 
transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of th e investee.
