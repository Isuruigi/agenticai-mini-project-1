Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results. 
Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, insurance, or maintenance costs, incl uding 
increased prices of new and used vehicle pa rts as a result of recent global supply ch ain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result 
of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine a nd the conflict in the Middle East, have and may continue to increase the costs inc urred 
by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as infl ation, increased food costs, in creased 
labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, 
particularly in certain internat ional markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factor s affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs  are 
beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increase d costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time pro viding 
services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income.
