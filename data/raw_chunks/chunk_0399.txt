impairment of long-
lived assets (including impairment of opera ting lease right-of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease co st for 
right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liabili ty for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an 
employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the  
termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions  have been met: management, having the authority to approve th e 
action, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classificatio ns and 
their locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of th e benefit arrangement in sufficient deta il to 
enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actio ns 
required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to th e plan will be made or that the plan w ill be 
withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the 
contract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic 
benefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date.
