ignificant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and suc h 
indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to  make interest and principal payments. In additio n, we 
may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities , which may result in dilution t o our 
stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and ex ecute 
acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail  to successfully address any of these risks, our business, fin ancial 
condition, and operating results may be harmed. 
In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to mana ge and successfully integrate 
acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal cont rols and any privacy, data security or AI risks associate d with 
such acquisitions, may harm our ope rating results and expans ion prospects. For example, Careem  has historically shared certain user 
data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership.
