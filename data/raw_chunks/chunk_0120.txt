rides and cost of meal deliveries (in cluding 
our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries) . In 2024, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our  global 
Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, partic ularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The number of  
countries and product types where cash is accepted is expected to continue to increase. The use of cash in connection with our 
technology raises regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regar ding the 
use of cash for ridesharing and certain juri sdictions prohibit the use of cash for ride sharing. Failure to comply with these re gulations 
could result in the imposition of significa nt fines and penalties and could result in  a regulator requiring that we suspend ope rations in 
those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, th e use of cash with our Mobility  products and De livery offering can 
increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, incl uding potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal 
acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Dr ivers while 
using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to ad equately address any of these c oncerns, we could suffer signific ant 
reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.
