Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in Cali fornia in November 2020. For further inform ation on risks related to our use of certa in

used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.” 
Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations re garding cross-border tr ansfers of personal data, including laws 
relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanis ms 
have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modi fications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of  
Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring person al 
data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European Commission  
deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the 
United States, this Framework has been ch allenged.
