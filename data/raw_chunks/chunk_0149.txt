not control the physical operation of  any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our  third-party service pr oviders.

sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These faciliti es may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power  loss, 
telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes , tornadoes, and similar events.
