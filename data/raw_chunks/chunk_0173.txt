ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, Ne w York City’s Taxi and Limousine 
Commission implemented a per-mile and per- minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, 
for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rate s 
took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulat ions have had an adverse impact on our financial performance i n 
New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In A ugust 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various 
measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire 
vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled vi a our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.  
Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a su rcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by vote rs in 
San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago th at 
imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago.
