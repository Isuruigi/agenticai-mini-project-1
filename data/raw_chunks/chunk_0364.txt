Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of  the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a bus iness combination and i s 
allocated to reporting units  expected to benefit from the bus iness combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annual ly, in 
the fourth quarter, or whenever events or  changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our 
reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation 
approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to de termine whether the ex istence of events or 
circumstances leads to a determination that  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its  carrying 
amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstance s, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a 
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not requi red. However, if we conclude otherwise, 
we proceed to the quantitative assessment. 
The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.
