We review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously 
recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes t o our 
disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated infor mation. 
Significant judgment is required to determin e both the probability and the estimated amo unt of loss. These estimates have been based 
on our assessment of the facts and circumst ances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and 
future events. 
The outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indi rect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if on e or 
more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in  excess of management’s expectat ions, our results of operations, 
financial condition, or cash flows, incl uding in a particular reporting period in wh ich any such outcome becomes probable and 
estimable, could be materially adversely affected.
