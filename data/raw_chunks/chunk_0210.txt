licenses for 
Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness 
and growth prospects would be adversely impacted. 
We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. 
We operate in an industry in which the comp etition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we  
use to onboard and attract Driver s may be challenged by competitors , government regulators, or i ndividual plaintiffs. For examp le, 
putative class actions have been filed by in dividual plaintiffs against us for allege d violation of the Telephone Consumer Prot ection 
Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received  text messages from us regard ing our Driver program without their 
consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to r eceive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time 
consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could resu lt in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustm ents to 
our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if  
competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices. 
Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our 
business.
