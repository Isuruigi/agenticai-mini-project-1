risdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or 
restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal. 
In addition, governmental agencies and regulators have and may in the future, among other things, prohibit acquisitions, 
divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significan t fines or penalties, require di vestiture of certain of our ass ets, or 
impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, incl uding limitations on our contractual relationships with 
platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, ma y 
continue to increase our costs or liabil ities or reduce demand for our platform, whic h could adversely affect our business, fin ancial 
condition, or operating results. 
We expect that antitrust enforcement agencies (including the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, 
with a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be  no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, 
acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or  enforcement action by the DOJ, the FTC or another antitrust 
enforcement agency. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit ou r future 
acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.
