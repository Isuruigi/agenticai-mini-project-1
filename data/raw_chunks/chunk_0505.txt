Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities 
Consolidated VIEs 
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because 
we have the power to direct the activities that most significan tly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we 
consolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs. 
Total assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated  VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $3.5 
billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Total li abilities included on the c onsolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of Dece mber 31, 
2023 and 2024 were $755 million and $724 million, respectively.
