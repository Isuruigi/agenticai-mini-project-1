an adverse effect on the relevant comp any’s operations; and will likely require substan tial 
additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. 
Further, we are contractually lim ited in our ability to sell or tr ansfer these assets. For exampl e, in connection with Aurora’s  
November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may 
be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value o f these 
assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment comp any under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 
“Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements 
of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pa y significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. 
Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses. 
We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unabl e to achieve or sustain profitability, our 
prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. 
Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily  an indication of future performance.
