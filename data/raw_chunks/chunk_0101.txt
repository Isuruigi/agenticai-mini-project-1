in o ur 
expenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability. 
We generate a significant percentage of ou r Gross Bookings from trips in large metrop olitan areas and trips to and from airport s. 
If our operations in large metropol itan areas or our ability to pr ovide trips to and from airpor ts are negatively affected, our  
financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. 
In 2024, we derived 20% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metr opolitan areas—Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York 
City in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in  the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large 
metropolitan areas, which has led us to of fer significant Driver incentives and cons umer discounts and promotions in these larg e 
metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration,  our business and financial results are susceptible to economic , social, 
weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious di seases 
or other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which 
we operate. Any short-term or l ong-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health 
concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adve rse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas.
