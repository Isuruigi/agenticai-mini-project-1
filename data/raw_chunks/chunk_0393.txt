Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability met hod, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. 
We account for uncertainty in tax positions  recognized in the consolid ated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit fr om 
an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be  sustained upon examination, including resol utions of 
any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the techni cal merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-n ot 
recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. 
We recognize accrued interest a nd penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income tax es 
in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce de ferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not 
expected to be realized based on the wei ghting of positive and negative evidence.
