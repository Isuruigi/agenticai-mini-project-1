w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate. 
There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate , or 
that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or ma rket acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any n ew expenses 
or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that  products and offerings developed by others will render our 
products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our de velopment efforts with respect to new products, offerings and  
technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established 
products, offerings and technologies. Even if  we are successful in developing new pr oducts, offerings or technologies, regulato ry 
authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in re sponse to our innovations that coul d increase our expenses or prev ent us 
from successfully commercializing new products, offerings or tec hnologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our 
investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.
