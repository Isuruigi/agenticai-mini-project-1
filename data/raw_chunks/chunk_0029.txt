research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. 
Seasonality 
Mobility 
We typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operati ng results as we generate highe r Gross Bookings in our fourth 
quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and busine ss demand, and typically generate lower Gros
s 
Bookings in our first quarter compared to other quarters due in pa rt to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down . We 
have typically experienced softer quarter-over-quarter Mobility trends in the first quarter. 
Delivery 
We typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operati ng results with increases in our  Gross Bookings in the fourth 
quarter compared to other quarters.
