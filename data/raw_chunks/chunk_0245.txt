Other Legal Proceedings 
While it is not possible to dete rmine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations , and proceedings brought against us, we 
believe that, except for the matters described above, the resoluti on of all such matters will not have a material adverse effec t on our 
consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be materi al to our consolidated results of operations in any one accoun ting 
period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be  involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and governme nt 
investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the 
classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with a pplicable law. This risk is e nhanced in certain jurisdictions outside 
the United States where we may be less protected under local laws  than we are in the United States. Although the results of the  legal 
proceedings, claims, and gove rnment investigations in  which we are involved ca nnot be predicted with certainty, we do not belie ve 
that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi tion, or 
operating results.
