Drivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or Delivery offerings in a s pecific 
market. This also includes any discounts offered under our subscr iption offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards

Refunds and Credits 
Refunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as sales and marketing expenses or 
as a reduction of revenue depending on whether the end-user is c onsidered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that 
we recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded as a reduction of revenue. 
Other

with specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental 
authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.
