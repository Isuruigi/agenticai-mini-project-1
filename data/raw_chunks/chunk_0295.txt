increase in accounts r eceivable 
and prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to tax matter s recorded as a receivable in other assets described in the No n-
Income Tax Matters section below. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023,  primarily consisting of $2.2 
billion of net income including non-controlling interests, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.9 b illion of 
stock-based compensation expense, $1.6 bi llion of unrealized gains from equity secu rities, $823 million of depreciation and 
amortization expense, $204 million gain from bus iness divestiture, as well as a $165 mill ion increase in cash from working capi tal. 
The increase in cash from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by an  increase 
in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as accounts receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities reflects a cash outflow of 
approximately $789 million (£631 million)  cash outflow related to pa yments of HMRC V AT for assessments for the period of March 
2022 to June 2023. For add itional information on this matter, refer to Note 14 – Commitments a nd Contingencies to our consolidated 
financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
