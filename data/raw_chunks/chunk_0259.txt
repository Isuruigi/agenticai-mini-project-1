Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue 
We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded 
that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for ot her parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this m odel, 
revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earn ings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting 
consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service. In certain markets we are res ponsible 
for the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets w e 
present revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of 
revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.
 
We would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar ba sis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip 
volume, Driver supply, macroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities.
