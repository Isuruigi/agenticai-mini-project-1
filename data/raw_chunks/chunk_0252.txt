Driver Classification Developments 
The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United 
States and abroad. We are involved in nu merous legal proceedings gl obally, including putative class and collective class action  
lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before admi nistrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, so cial 
security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be  treated as our employees (or as  workers or quasi-employees where those 
statuses exist), rather than as independent  contractors. Of particular  note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020 , the 
California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in 
San Francisco Superior C ourt (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alle ging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an 
injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitiv e advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers .
