hich are inherently difficult to value given the la ck of publicly available information. We also hold equity sec urities 
with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held entities and public 
companies may increase the volatil ity in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these inve stments. 
In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a  set period 
of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these investments was $8.8 billion, including e quity 
method investments. 
Foreign Currency Risk 
We transact business globally in multiple cu rrencies. Our international revenue, as well  as costs and expenses denominated in 
foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in fore ign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are ex posed to 
foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating e xpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our  future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S . 
dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified 
across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.
