reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical 
region, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. 
Our segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to 
evaluate segment operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. The CODM does not evaluate 
operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown 
in the table below). 
The following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes and 
income (loss) from equity method investments (in millions):
