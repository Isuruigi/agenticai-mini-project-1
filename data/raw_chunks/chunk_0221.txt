anies we  
acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual proper ty 
infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have an interest loses rights to  
42 
valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third part y intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our 
investment may materially decline. 
Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, c ould be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, c ould 
divert our management’s atten tion and other resources, and c ould hurt goodwill associated with our  brand. These claims may also  
subject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using tec hnology, content, branding, or bus iness 
methods found to be in viol ation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adverse ly 
affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses. 
We may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be 
available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant ro yalties or 
license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.
