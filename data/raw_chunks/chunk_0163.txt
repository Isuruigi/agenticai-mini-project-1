filed in such jurisdictions. New 
laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the count ries in which we do business or require us to change the mann er in 
which we operate our business. As a result of the large and e xpanding scale of our international business activities, many of t hese 
changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our wo rldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, oper ating 
results, and cash flows. 
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. fede ral net operating loss carryforwards of $176 m illion that begin to expire in 2031 and 
$8.2 billion that have an unlimite d carryover period. As of Decemb er 31, 2024, we had U.S. stat e net operating loss carryforwar ds of  
32 
$7.5 billion that started expiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimite d carryover period. As of  December 31, 2024, w e had 
foreign net operating loss carry forwards of $759 million that st arted expiring in 2024  and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited  
carryover period. Realization of these net op erating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a ri sk that 
our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to  offset future income tax li abilities, which could material ly and 
adversely affect our operating results.
