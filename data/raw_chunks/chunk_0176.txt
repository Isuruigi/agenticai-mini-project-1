laws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in thes e instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject 
to scrutiny by government authorities. Our c ontinuation of this practice and other past  practices may result in fines or other penalties 
against us and Drivers imposed by local re gulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are neces sary to 
operate in such jurisdictions will not be re newed. Such fines and penalties have in th e past been, and may in the future continue to be, 
imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop provi ding services on our platform. In many instances, we make the 
business decision as a gesture of goodwill to pa y the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pa y Drivers’ defense costs, which, in th e 
aggregate, can be in the millions  of dollars. Furthermore, such business practice s may also result in negative press coverage, which 
may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely af fect our revenue.
