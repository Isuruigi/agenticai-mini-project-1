stock on the 
grant date. 
For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determ ine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model a s 
described above for service-based awards. 
Market-Based Awards 
We have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only u pon the satisfaction of the following conditions: service-based 
conditions, performance-based conditions, and/or market-based c onditions. The service-based condition for these awards generall y is 
satisfied over three or four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performan ce 
targets. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achieve ment of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined  based 
on our stock price. 
For market-based awards, we de termine the grant-date fair value utilizing a M onte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates 
various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the vol atility of 
common stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility of  Uber’s stock price. We estimate the expected term based on various 
exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
