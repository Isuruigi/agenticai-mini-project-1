Insurance Reserves 
We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance 
subsidiary, to provide for the potential li abilities for certain risks, including au to liability, uninsured and underinsured mo torist, auto 
physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment 
expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid ob ligation for such insurance rela ted risks and includes an amou nt for 
case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of 
the ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted actuari al methods applied to historic al claim and loss experience. I n 
addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs , 
which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant i ndustry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjus ted as 
experience develops and new information becomes known.
