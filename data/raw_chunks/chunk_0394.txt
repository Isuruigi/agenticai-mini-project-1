llowances are established when necessary to reduce de ferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not 
expected to be realized based on the wei ghting of positive and negative evidence. Future  realization of deferred tax assets ult imately 
depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appr opriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gai n) 
within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the a pplicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax asset s for 
recoverability based on historical taxable in come, projected future taxable income, ex cess tax benefits related to stock-based 
compensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment 
regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future mark et conditions and the ability to successful ly 
execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ab ility to recover deferred tax asse ts, our 
income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in  which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law orderi ng 
approach in assessing the realizability of  net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income 
(“GILTI”). 
We have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.
