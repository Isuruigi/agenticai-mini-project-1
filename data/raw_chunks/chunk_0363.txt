liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those f air values 
is recorded as goodwill. During th e measurement period, which may be up to one year from the ac quisition date, we may record 
adjustments to the assets acquired and lia bilities assumed with  the corresponding offset to goo dwill. Upon the conclusion of th e 
measurement period or final determination of  the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any 
subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
