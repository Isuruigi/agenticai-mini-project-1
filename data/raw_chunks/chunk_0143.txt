s network operators to provid e us 
with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the spee d and 
availability of our platform. If our platfo rm is unavailable when platform users atte mpt to access it, or if our platform does not load as 
quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to  our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our 
competitors’ products or offerings more often. In  addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by natio nal 
telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may 
decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease. 
Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operati on of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an 
unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could re sult in 
delays or interruptions to our products, of ferings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. 
Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down  
our platform at the routing level.
