rmine that an entity for which we hold a c ontractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and 
that we are the primary beneficiary, we c onsolidate such entity in the consolidated financial st atements. The primary beneficia ry of a 
VIE is the party that meets both of the foll owing criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the 
economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb  losses or the right to receive benefits that in either ca se could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodi cally, we determine whether any changes in  the interest or relationship with the entity 
impact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not d eemed to 
be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with appl icable 
GAAP. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.
