Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calc ulate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, 
including dynamic pricing, ha ve been, and will likely continue  to be, challenged, banned, limit ed in emergencies, and capped in  
certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calcu late consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated  
fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limit ed the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Haw aii 
became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.  Additional 
regulation of our pricing models could incr ease our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing  model 
has been the subject of litigation and regul atory inquiries related to, among other thi ngs, the calculation of and statements r egarding 
consumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies 
and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of m unicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect  to our 
Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our M obility offering.
