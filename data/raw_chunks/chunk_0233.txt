This provision would not apply to suits brou ght to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim f or 
which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 
Our amended and restated certificate of inco rporation provides that the federal district  courts of the United States of America will 
be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cau se of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and  
contingent upon a final adjudication in the St ate of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although  the 
Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provi sions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find  such 
provisions to be unenforceable. 
These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable  for 
disputes with us or our direct ors, officers, or other employees, which may disc ourage lawsuits against us and our directors, of ficers, 
and other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolv ing the 
dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.
