pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our 
network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. 
If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan ar eas in the 
future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, 
and operating results would suffer. 
In 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from tr ips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a 
result of this concentration, our operating results are susceptib le to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability 
of drivers using our platform to  provide trips to and from airports. Sustained dec lines in air travel have in the past, and may  in the 
future, suppress demand for airpor t-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from ai rport trips. For example, du ring 
the height of the pandemic, trav el behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing th e demand for Mobility to and from air ports. 
Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within air port boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders 
obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations 
altogether.
