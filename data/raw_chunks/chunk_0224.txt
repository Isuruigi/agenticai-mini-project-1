in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned entities, we  believe that we are not an 
investment company as defi ned by the Investment Compa ny Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be  
deemed an investment company, such a determination would requi re us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply 
with restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital s tructure 
and our ability to transact with subsidiaries and other entities, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid 
such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of th e 
Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our  business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our 
assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.
