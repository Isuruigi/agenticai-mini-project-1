s financing transactions, such as the i ssuance of preferred stock to ne w investors. The price in thes e 
transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of th e investee. Additionally, based on the timing,  volume, 
and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including  the 
guideline public company approach. The guideline public company appr oach relies on publicly availabl e market data of comparable  
companies and uses compar ative valuation multiple s of the investee’s revenue  (actual and forecasted),  and therefore, unobservab le 
input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections. 
Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pr icing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method 
or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The 
model involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility. 
An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in is olation, such as the security price in a signifi cant financing 
transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase  or decrease in our estimate of fair value.
