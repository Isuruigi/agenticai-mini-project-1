d be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. 
Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily  an indication of future performance. These fluctuations ma y 
be a result of a variety of factors, some  of which are beyond our control. In additi on, we experience seas onal fluctuations in our 
financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher reve nue in our fourth quarter compar ed to other quarters due in p art to 
fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate  lower revenue in our first quarter compared to other quarter s due 
in part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth 
in Mobility trends in the first quarter. Fo r Delivery, we expect to experience seasona l increases in our revenue in the fourth quarter 
compared to other quarters, although the historical growth of De livery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. Our growth has m ade, 
and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over 
time as our growth slows. Other seasonal tr ends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which 
would contribute to fluctuations in our op erating results.
