orm. For example, as we expand our 
offerings in new areas, such as  non-emergency medical tran sportation, we may be subject to additional h ealthcare-related federal and 
state laws and regulations. Additionally, becau se our offerings are frequently first-to -market in the jurisd ictions in which we  operate, 
several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or blo ck our 
ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in thos e jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We  are 
actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and ar e lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our 
business, especially our ridesharing services. Further, becaus e a substantial portion of our bus iness involves vehicles that run on fossil 
fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to cu rb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. Moreover,  in 
May 2021, California adopted a regul ation requiring 90% of vehicle mi les traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have bee n in 
EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally , proposed ridesharing regulations  in Egypt and other jurisdic tions 
may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, wh ich we may not be willing to pr ovide.
