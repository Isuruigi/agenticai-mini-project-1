br and and reputation, and while we have t aken significant steps to rehabilitate our 
brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. 
Maintaining and enhancing our  brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to 
preserve and deepen the engageme nt of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scru tiny, 
litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment. 
We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and 
fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity adversely affects our brand and reput ation, makes it difficult for us to attr act and 
retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulator y 
scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental i nvestigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, 
increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so. 
In 2024, we released a third safety report, which provides the publ ic with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other  
critical safety incidents claimed to have  occurred on our platform in the United Stat es.
