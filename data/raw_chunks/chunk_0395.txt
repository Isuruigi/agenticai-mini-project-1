assessing the realizability of  net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income 
(“GILTI”). 
We have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost. 
The establishment of deferred tax assets fr om intra-entity transfers of intangible as sets requires management to make significa nt 
estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Si gnificant estimates in valuing intangible as sets may 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible asset s, 
comparable transaction values, and/or disc ount rates. The discount rates used to disc ount expected future cash flows to present  value 
are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash  flow. 
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are re asonable and appropriate, they ar e based, in part, on historic al 
experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occu r 
that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
