the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in 
operating our business. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding inde btedness of $9.6 billion aggregate pr incipal amount. In addition, up to 
approximately $128 million of  Careem Convertible Notes remain  subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of 
December 31, 2024. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our  existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may  incur 
additional debt, secure existing or future de bt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the 
purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. 
We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations  to pay interest and principal on our 
indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporat e 
purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and o ther 
investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in  our 
business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flex ibility in planning for, or r eacting to, changes in our busine ss and the 
industry, and prevent us from ta king advantage of busines s opportunities as they arise.
