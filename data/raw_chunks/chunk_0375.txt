rectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or 
liabilities. 
Our primary financial instruments include receivables, investme nts in debt and equity securi ties, accounts payable, accrued 
liabilities, long-term debt and warrants. The estimated fair valu e of marketable debt securiti es, accounts receivable, accounts  payable 
and accrued liabilities approximates their ca rrying value due to the short-term maturiti es of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 – 
Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information. 
Variable Interest Entities 
We evaluate our ownership, contra ctual, and other interests in entities to determin e if we have a variable interest in an entit y. 
These evaluations are complex and involve judgment, estimates, and assumptions based on available historical and prospective 
information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a c ontractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and 
that we are the primary beneficiary, we c onsolidate such entity in the consolidated financial st atements.
