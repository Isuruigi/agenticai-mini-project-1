ely de signing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal contro l 
over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability  to accurately report our financ ial condition or operating results. If we are 
unable to conclude that our internal control over financial repor ting is effective, or if we or  our independent registered publ ic 
accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our in ternal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor  
confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and w e 
could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock ex change on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regu latory 
authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these 
and other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.
