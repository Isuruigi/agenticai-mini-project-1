data  center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our c o-located 
data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we a re unable 
to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially re asonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of ou r 
products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products 
and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services through our platfo rm, and 
reduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our busin ess and operating results may be harmed if current and potential  
Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data 
storage and computational capacity sufficie ntly or on commercially r easonable terms, our ability to  innovate and introduce new 
products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business. 
Our use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to 
possible litigation.
