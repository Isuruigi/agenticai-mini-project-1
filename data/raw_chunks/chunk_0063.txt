raints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce  the 
Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if Carriers 
choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers 
in specific geographic markets to attract Shippers to our platfo rm. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other deli very 
services in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing 
websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack 
access to the most popular merchants, such that our Delivery offering w ill become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A 
significant amount of our Delivery Gross B ookings come from a limited number of large re staurant groups and other merchants, an d 
this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our op erating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse deve lopments 
experienced by our significant merchant partners. If platform us ers choose to use other rideshari ng, delivery, or logistics ser vices, we 
may lack sufficient opportunities for Driver s to earn a fare, Carriers to  book a shipment, or mercha nts to provide their goods,  which 
may reduce the perceived utility of our platform.
