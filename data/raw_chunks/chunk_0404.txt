historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent even ts and 
can be affected by many factors, such as cl aims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environment s. As

estimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Loss Contingencies 
We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations 
that may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indet erminate 
amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be 
reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of  loss can be reasonably estima ted, we 
disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements. 
We review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously 
recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed.
