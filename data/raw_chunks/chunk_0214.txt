impersonates a Driver, by consumers using our services, or by thir d parties. As we expand to include more offerings on our plat form, 
our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general 
liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover al l potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, 
or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Driv ers who use our platform or where liability is otherwise alleged  against 
us, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liabili ty, we could 
incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them . If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay 
otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are s ubject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using 
our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or 
actions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S.
