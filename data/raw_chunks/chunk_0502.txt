In May 2023, we received an assessment for 2019 and 2020 Driver  social security contributions from the Brazilian Federal 
Revenue Bureau (“FRB”). We are contesting the assessment and we f iled our administrative appeal with the FRB in June 2023. In 
April 2024, we received a positive decision from the FRB. This decision was appealed, and another positive decision to Uber was  
issued by the Court of Appeals in September 2024, maintaining th e first instance deci sion. If the tax aut horities in Brazil app eal this 
second positive decision, Uber will continue to defend its position. 
In December 2024, due to the abse nce of an appeal from the Na tional Treasury, a formal docum ent was issued confirming the 
closure of the case in the Company’s favor. As a result, the case has been archived and closed.
