nd regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapi dly evolving, making implementation 
and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, un certain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for examp le, 
those relating to the processing of data for purposes of advert ising and profile creation, whic h are subject to evolving disclo sure, 
choice, and consent requirements in the EU, United States, and ot her jurisdictions. Compliance with such laws may require changes to 
our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase 
compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. A dditionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply w ith 
privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders  and regulations could result in proceedings or actions again st us by 
individuals, consumer rights groups, government al entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigati ng and 
defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may 
subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If a ny of these events were to occur, our business and financial re sults could 
be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.
