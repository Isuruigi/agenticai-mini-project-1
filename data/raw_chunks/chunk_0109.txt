liability and a material  loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputat ion and 
brand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party ser vice 
providers to host or otherwise process some  of our data and that of platform users,  and they have experienced, and may again 
experience, security and privacy incidents.  Any failure by such third party to preven t or mitigate security breaches or imprope r access 
to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. 
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently 
and are often unrecognizable until la unched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate 
preventative measures. Our servers, internal systems, and platform  may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electro nic 
break-ins that our security measures may no t detect. Individuals able to circumvent our  security measures, or insiders who viol ate our 
policies, may misappropriate confidential, pr oprietary, or personal information held by  or on behalf of us, disrupt our operati ons, 
damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business.
