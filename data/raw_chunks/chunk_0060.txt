certain other categories in w hich 
we compete are rela tively nascent, and we cannot  guarantee that they will  stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allo w us to 
maintain profitability. 
We have incurred significant losses, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses t o 
increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not maintain profitability. 
We incurred an operating loss of $1.8 b illion in the year ended December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2024, we had an 
accumulated deficit of $20.7 billion. We will need to generate and sust ain increased revenue  levels and decr ease proportionate 
expenses in future periods to achieve or maintain profitabilit y in many of our largest markets, including in the United States,  and even 
if we do, we may not be able to  maintain or increase profitabili ty. We may incur losses in the near term as a result of substan tial 
increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in  order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants , 
Shippers, and Carriers using our platform  through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new mar kets; 
increase our research and development expenses; expand marketi ng channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add ne w 
products and offerings to our platform.
