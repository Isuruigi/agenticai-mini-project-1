ion, screening, or background check process, or  that limit our  ability to acce ss 
information used in the background check process in an efficien t manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required 
changes in the qualification, screening, and background check pro cess (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postm ates 
or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Dr ivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit ne w 
Drivers to our platform, which would advers ely impact our business and growth. Furthe rmore, we rely on a single background-chec k 
provider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to a rrange for adequate background checks from a different provider o n 
commercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would resu lt in 
our inability to onboard new Drivers or re tain existing Drivers undergoi ng periodic background checks that are required to cont inue 
using our platform. 
Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage , 
including negative publicity regarding our br and and reputation, and while we have t aken significant steps to rehabilitate our 
brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
