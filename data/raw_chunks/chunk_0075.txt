ies. We believe that autonomous vehi cle technologies may ha ve the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we 
compete and that autonomous vehi cles present substantia l opportunities. Several companies other than Au rora, including Waymo, 
Tesla, Zoox (a subsidiary of Amazon), Motional, Avride and Nu ro, are developing autonomous vehi cle technologies in the United 
States, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, as are similar companies globally, and we expect that th ey will 
use such technology to further compete with us in the mobili ty, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has introduced a 
commercialized ridehail ing fleet of autonomous vehi cles on its own platform in addition to  a fleet of autonom ous vehicles that it 
makes available through our platform, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than 
we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform or that our commercial partnerships could expire or that our autonomous 
vehicle partners could experience organizati onal failures of their own or otherwise remove their vehicles from our platform.
