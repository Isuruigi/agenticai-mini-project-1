Australia Class Actions 
In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Vict oria, Australia, against us and certain of  our 
subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hi re-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the  Uber entities 
conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breach ing transport legislation or 
commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these op erations 
caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi  
licenses. In March, April and Oc tober 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same 
claim. In December 2024, the Supreme Court of Victoria approved a settlement with no admission of liability by Uber. The approval is 
subject to any appeals and the approval of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.
