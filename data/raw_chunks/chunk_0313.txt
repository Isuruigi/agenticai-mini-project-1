appropriate estimates and 
assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affe ct the calculation of the fair value of the investments and t he 
determination of the impairment charges. 
Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
We review goodwill for impairment annually (i n the fourth quarter) and wh enever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that goodwill might be impaired. We make cer tain judgments and assumptions to determ ine our reporting units and in allocating 
shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting unit s is based 
on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment mana gers review financial results, evaluate performance, and alloc ate 
resources. 
Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairme nt include, among other factors:  financial performance; legal, 
regulatory, contractual, politic al, business, and other factors;  entity specific factors; industry and ma rket considerations, 
macroeconomic conditions, a nd other relevant events and factor s affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that i t is 
more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.

Performing a quantitative goodwill impa irment test includes the dete rmination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involve s 
significant estimates and assumptions.
