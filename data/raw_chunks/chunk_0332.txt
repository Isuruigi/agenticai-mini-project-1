reasonable assurance regarding the relia bility of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc ounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporti ng includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to th e 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately a nd fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asset s of the 
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of th e company are being made only  in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, p rojections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to  the risk that controls may become inadequate because of cha nges in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
