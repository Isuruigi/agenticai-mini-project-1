We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in mu ltiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisd ictions. We are unable to predict 
what other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in  the future or what effects such future changes would have o n our 
business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, polic ies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate coul d increase 
the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial positi on, future 
operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we  have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; a nd 
increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxe s in 
one or more jurisdictions where we operate . The governments of countries in which we  operate and other governmental bodies coul d 
make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in th eir jurisdictions that are cont rary to the way in which we have 
interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations de scribed above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New 
laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the count ries in which we do business or require us to change the mann er in 
which we operate our business.
