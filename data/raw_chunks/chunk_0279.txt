2024 Compared to 2023 
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider 
both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight 
of all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  
As of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U. S. pre-tax book income adjusted for 
permanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual pe riod ended on December 31, 2024,  we 
utilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both 
objective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.
