September 15, 2054 (the “2054 Senior Note” and, together with th e 2030 Senior Note and the 2034 Senior Note, the “Notes”). The  
104 
Notes are our senior unsecured debt obligat ions and the entire principal amounts of the Notes are due at the respective maturit y dates 
and therefore, the Notes are classified as long-term. 
In November 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our Notes offering, along with cash on hand, to redeem, in full, the 
outstanding 2026 Senior Note. As a result, we recognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 
2024 in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. Following the redemption, the 2026 Senior Note is no 
longer outstanding.
