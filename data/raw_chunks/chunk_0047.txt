Drivers will be able to maintain their st atus as independent contract ors under California law and th at we and our competitors w ill be 
required to comply with the pr ovisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolv e the California Attorney General’
s 
preliminary injunction was grante d in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, a nd we also may face li ability relating to p eriods 
before the effective date of  Proposition 22. The California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality  of Proposition 22; howev er, 
legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 may continue to be filed. 
We face similar challenges in other jurisd ictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the 
Massachusetts Attorney General filed a comp laint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an  
injunction. That case was resolved in June 2024 with the understa nding that drivers would continue to be classified as independ ent 
contractors. If we do not prevail in current litigation or simila r actions that may be brought in the future, we may be require d to treat 
Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions.
