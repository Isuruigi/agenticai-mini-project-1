ut safety incidents reportedly occurring on 
or related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and 
financial results. 
Further, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accide nts, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are 
caused by Drivers, consumers, or third partie s while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not 
actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consume rs or 
third parties. Furthermore, operating a moto r vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addi tion, the growth of our Delivery offering  and 
launch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Dr ivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and 
bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while 
driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential  
injuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, n avigate, 
and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, 
all of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death.
