f realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight 
of all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  
As of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U. S. pre-tax book income adjusted for 
permanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual pe riod ended on December 31, 2024,  we 
utilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both 
objective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight. 
Based on all available positive and negativ e evidence, including the objective and ve rifiable positive evidence as described ab ove 
and anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred
 tax assets 
will be realizable. We continue to maintain  a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not m ore-
likely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. 
Furthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will 
not be fully realizable.
