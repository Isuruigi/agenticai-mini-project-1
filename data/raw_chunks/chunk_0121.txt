using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to ad equately address any of these c oncerns, we could suffer signific ant 
reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business. E xpanding cash payments to additiona l cities or countries could 
amplify these risks. 
In addition, establishing the proper infrastr ucture to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex,  and 
has in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee fo r certain of our cash-based trip s. We 
have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips a nd deliveries, as well as syste ms for us 
to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, so me of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely- adopted 
by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarant ee 
these systems will be  effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks 
with respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our 
agreements or if our collecti on systems fail, we may be adve rsely affected by both the inability  to collect amounts due and the  cost of 
enforcing the terms of our cont racts, including litigation.
