In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ 
stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways  unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. 
In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action lit igation following periods of market volatility. For example, be ginning in 
September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in Cali fornia state and federal courts against us, our directors, cer tain of our 
officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statem ent alleging violations of secu rities laws in connection wit h our 
IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and 
seriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of a ny of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to 
decline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stoc k price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell y our 
shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
