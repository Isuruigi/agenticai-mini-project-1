Swiss Social Security Rulings 
Several Swiss administrative bodies have issued  decisions in which they classify Driver s or Couriers as employees of Uber for 
social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. 
On March 21, 2023, the Federal Tribunal ruled that Drivers who have used the Uber App in 2014 qualify as employees for social 
security purposes. The litigations with regards to the so cial security contributions are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In October 
2024, the Social Security authority decided that the changes to our 2023 model are not sufficient to classify drivers as indepe ndent 
contractors. We have filed an appeal against this decision. 
On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by wh ich both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton of Geneva are 
classified as employees of Uber B.V ., Uber Portier B.V . and Uber Switzerland GmbH. Following the ruling of the Federal Tribunal  on 
Eats, the Social Security authorities claimed the payment of social security contributions since the launch of Uber Eats. We re ached a 
settlement with the Canton of Geneva on Mobility with regards to social security implications.
