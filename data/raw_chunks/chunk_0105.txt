Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other 
personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for o ur 
competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past 
led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attr act high-quality employees. Our employees worked from home for a lmost 
two years in light of the pandemic, and a lthough we have implemented ou r “return to office” plan, which includes a shift to a h ybrid 
model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybr id model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin g 
our corporate culture, productivity and avai lability of key personnel and other empl oyees necessary to conduct our business, 
increasing attrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the off ice.
