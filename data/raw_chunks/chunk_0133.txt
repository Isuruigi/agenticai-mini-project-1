progress has been made, but without more a ggressive action, we cannot achieve all of our goals. All of our climate change-relat ed 
goals are intentionally challenging, and are therefore subject to  risks, uncertainties, third pa rty information or action, and conditions, 
many of which are outside of our control. Progressing towards our climate goals requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and 
management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or 
climate goals. For example, when we set our 2025 climate goals, we  anticipated that strong regulatory measures, alongside susta ined 
industry-wide investment , would support our efforts. While progress has been made, without more aggressive action from 
policymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated.
