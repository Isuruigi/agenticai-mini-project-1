Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
Non-Financial Assets 
Our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and propert y and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an 
impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. 
Non-Marketable Equity Securities 
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privatel y held companies without readily determinable fair values. The 
carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or 
similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measur ement alternative) or for impair ment. Any changes in carrying value are 
recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
