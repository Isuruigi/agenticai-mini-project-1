life or lease term 
Leasehold improvements  Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term 
When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the 
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the cons olidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maint enance 
and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. 
We capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstandi ng 
debt, in developing internal-use software  once planning has been completed, manageme nt has authorized and committed project 
funding, and it is probable that the project  will be completed and the software will function as intended. Amortization of such  costs 
occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of  the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use. 
Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incu rred. In 
addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets. 
Leases
