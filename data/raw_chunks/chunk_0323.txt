ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily in clude interest rate risk, invest ment 
risk, and foreign currency risk as follows: 
Interest Rate Risk 
As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately $1.97 billion in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2030 Refinanced Term 
Loans, which were floating rate notes carried at amortized cost and subject to interest rate risk. In September 2024, we fully repaid all 
loans outstanding under this term loan agreement. As a result, our  primary exposure to market risks for changes in interest rat es relate 
primarily to the new Credit Agr eement of which we currently have no drawn am ounts as of December 31,  2024. For additional 
information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arra ngements in the notes to the consolidated financial statement s 
included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of inte rest rates, increasing in periods of decl ining 
rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest  rates would 
have decreased the fair value of our notes by $461 million as of December 31, 2024.
