However, if we conclude otherwise, 
we proceed to the quantitative assessment. 
The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the  fair 
value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional st eps are necessary. However, if the book value 
of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an  impairment loss will be recognized in an  amount equal to that excess, limited to  the total 
amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information. 
Intangible Assets, Net 
Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range fro m one 
to 18 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for im pairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evalua tion of 
Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.
