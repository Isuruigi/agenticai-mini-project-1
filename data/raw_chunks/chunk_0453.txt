Credit Agreement 
On September 26, 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (t he “Credit Agreement”) which replaced the existing Revolving 
Credit Facility initially entered into in 2015. 
The Credit Agreement provides for $5.0 billion in aggregate amount of commitments  for senior unsecured revolving loans, which 
will mature on September 26, 2029, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit 
Agreement provides that we may obtain, subject to the satisfacti on of customary conditions, loans in U.S. Dollars or certain al ternate 
currencies. Proceeds from any borrowings unde r the Credit Agreement may be used fo r general corporate purposes. The Credit 
Agreement is unsecured and is not guaranteed by any of our subs idiaries. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants 
restricting our and certain of our subsidia ries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes. T he Credit 
Agreement also contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement as of 
December 31, 2024.
