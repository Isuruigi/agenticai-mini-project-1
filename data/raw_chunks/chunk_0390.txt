Performance-Based Awards 
We have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), and stock options that 
vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and perform ance-based conditions. The servic e-based condition for these awards  
generally is satisfied over three or four  years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specif ied 
performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics.  We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-bas ed 
equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an  accelerated attribution method over the requisite service perio d, 
which is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. 
For performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date  fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the 
grant date. 
For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determ ine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model a s 
described above for service-based awards.
