tly verified by any third part y and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics publish ed by 
third parties due to differences in source s, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a 
number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these me trics may change over time, which could result in unexpected 
changes to our metrics, including the metr ics we publicly disclose, or our estimate s of our category position. If the internal systems 
and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, t he data 
we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for t he 
applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenge s in measuring how our products are used across large populations  
globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who ha ve multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Term s of 
Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior . In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we m easure 
data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could a ffect our 
long-term strategies .
