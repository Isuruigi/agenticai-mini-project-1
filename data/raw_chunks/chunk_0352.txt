consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers 
(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end- user(s)” 
or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public 
transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shipp ers 
(“Shippers”) with carriers (“Carriers”) in the freight indus try. The foundation of our platform is this network of Drivers, Cou riers, 
Merchants, Carriers as well as Riders, Eaters and Shippers (col lectively “Platform Participant(s)”). We define Platform Earner( s) as 
Drivers, Couriers and Merchants as well as Carriers. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve 
everyday problems. 
Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding 
Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia).
