s a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that 
such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators ma y block payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers.  Such 
regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments 
we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. 
Payments made by platform users with payment instruments or pa yment accounts issued in jurisdictions such as the EEA, the UK 
and Mexico for services provided through our platform may be  subject to Strong Customer Au thentication (“SCA”) regulatory 
requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to  engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. 
These additional authentication requirements in the EEA, UK and Mexi co or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other 
countries may make our platform user expe rience substantially less convenient, and su ch loss of convenience could meaningfully 
reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform 
entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial c ondition, operating results, and prospects.
