s to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our 
payment operations in the EEA to fall within  the scope of European payments regulation.  As a result, one of our subsidiaries, U ber 
Payments B.V ., is directly subject to fi nancial services regulations (including t hose relating to anti-money laundering, terror ist 
financing, and sanctioned or prohibited pers ons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts busines s. 
Effective July 1, 2020, we transitioned a ll our payment operations to the Uber Paymen ts B.V . regulated entity in the EEA countries in 
which we are required to do so by the European payments regulations. 
In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our  business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or 
requirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money 
transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laun dering, counter-terrori st financing, banki ng, 
systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment proc esses, and import and export re strictions. Our business operations , 
including our payments to Drivers and mercha nts, may not always comply with these fi nancial laws and regulations.
