2023, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor exercised their right to require that either Freight Holding conduct an IPO 
or we redeem them at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, described above. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Frei ght Series A preferred st ock held by the 2020 Fr eight Series A Investor  is classified as a 
redeemable non-controlling in terest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in  our control. Given the 2020 Fre ight 
Series A Investor exercised their right during the fourth quarter of 2023, this redeemable non-controlling interest was deemed probable 
of redemption. Based on the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, this redeemable non-controlling interest was re-measured t o its 
full estimated redemption value with an adjustment of $286 milli on. Upon the redemption date in October 2024, we repurchased th e 
2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock in cash for $851 million. 
In July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purch ase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding's Series A 
Preferred Stock to The Public Investment F und, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully dilu ted 
basis at the time of the sale.
