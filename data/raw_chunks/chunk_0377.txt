o seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services 
(collectively the “Uber Service”). In many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users. In these markets, we charge  end-
users a direct fee for use of the platform  or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fr om 
customers' use of Freight services. 
 
We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as business models and other factors evolve. 
Mobility and Delivery Agreements 
We primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines 
the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transac tion. Upon acceptance of a transa ction, Drivers and Merchants a gree 
to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes 
enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contra ct exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the D rivers 
and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses. 
The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole pe rformance obligation in the tran saction, which is to connect 
Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.
