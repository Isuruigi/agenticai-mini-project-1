tform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform 
entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial c ondition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a resul t of 
implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fa il to be authenticated due to platform users not completing a ll 
necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for  
services received by those users. A substantial increase in th e frequency with which we make Driver payments without having 
received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely af fect our business, financial condition, operating results, and  
prospects. 
In addition, laws related to money transmission and online paymen ts are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our 
ability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all . For 
example, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our 
payment operations in the EEA to fall within  the scope of European payments regulation.
