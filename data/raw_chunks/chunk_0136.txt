ccurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adve rsely 
impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
Outbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mi tigate such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and 
could in the future adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks related to  health 
epidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For example, the pandemic and responses ther eto 
had an adverse impact on our business a nd operations, including, for example, by re ducing the demand for our Mobility offerings  
globally, and affecting travel beha vior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the 
pandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.
 
We cannot predict the impact a catastrophic event, including dis ease, weather event, war or terrorist attack will have on our 
business, end-users’ behaviors, business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be  adversely impacted as a result of the adverse 
impact our business partners and third-part y vendors suffer.
