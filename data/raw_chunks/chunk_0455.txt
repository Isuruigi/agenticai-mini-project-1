We had a revolving credit agreement initially entered into duri ng 2015 with certain lenders, which provided for $2.3 billion in  
credit maturing on June 13, 2023 (“Revolving Credit Facility”). On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving  
Credit Facility to, among other things, (i ) provide for approximately $2.2 billion of  revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend  the 
maturity date for the commitments and loan s from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027, ( iii) reduce the minimum liquidity covenant fr om 
$1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based interest rate with a SOFR based in terest 
rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative cove nants under the amended revolving cr edit agreement. The Revolving 
Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material dom estic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit 
agreement also contained customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ab ility to incur debt, incur lien s, and 
undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintain a certain  level of liquidity specified in the contractual agreement. T he credit 
agreement also contained customary events of default. The Revol ving Credit Facility also contained restrictions on the payment of 
dividends.
