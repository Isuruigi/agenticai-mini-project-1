ng by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders 
obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations 
altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking 
the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sancti ons, including further bans on our ability t o operate 
within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances 
of non-compliance by Drivers, woul d significantly disrupt our  operations. In addition,  if drop-offs or pick -ups of riders becom e 
inconvenient because of airport ru les or regulations, or more e xpensive because of airport-impos ed fees, the number of Drivers or 
consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our busin ess, financial condition, and operating results. While we have 
entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of  our 
platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and 
we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.
