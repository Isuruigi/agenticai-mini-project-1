or platforms, flaws in third-party software  or 
services, intentional acts or errors by our employees or third-pa rty service providers, or breaches  in the security of these sy stems or 
platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees , contractors, or platform users to disclose information to g ain 
access to our data or the data of platform users. If our inci dent response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do  not 
resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result  in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. 
Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a 
particularly attractive target for such atta cks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes tha t are 
designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security 
breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide ab solute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a 
result of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunc tions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; 
government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we ma y incur significant costs in pr otecting against or remediating 
cyberattacks.
