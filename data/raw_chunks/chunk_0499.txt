IPO Securities Litigation 
Beginning in September 2019, putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors , 
certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO re gistration statement, alleging viol ations of securities laws i n 
connection with our May 2019 IPO. Following dismissal of certain ma tters, the remaining actions we re consolidated in the Northe rn 
District of California, which granted Plai ntiffs’ motion for class certification in July 2022. On April 24, 2024, the parties i nformed the 
court that they were negotiating a settlement  agreement, and the court stayed the litig ation. On July 19, 2024, the parties exe cuted and 
publicly filed a settlement agreement. On August 9, 2024, the c ourt granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On December  4, 
2024, the court granted final approval and the matter was resolved . The settlement has been fully paid. Separately, a sharehold er filed 
a follow-on derivative action on behalf of the Company, against the same officers and directors, and that matter has been staye d since 
February 2021, with a status conference scheduled for March 13, 2025.
