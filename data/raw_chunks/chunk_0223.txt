tions of relevant  accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulati ons, and 
changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our bus iness 
model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financ ial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any 
period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, 
and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls. 
If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect 
on our business. 
The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirem ents that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” 
are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not re sult in 
being characterized as an “investment co mpany” under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-
investment company business. Although a signi ficant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (in cluding 
in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned entities, we  believe that we are not an 
investment company as defi ned by the Investment Compa ny Act.
