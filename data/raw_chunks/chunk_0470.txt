$1.2 billion, excluding broker commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2024, we had $5.8 billion available to repurchase shares 
pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. 
In January 2025, we announced that we entered into an acc elerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large 
financial institution to repurch ase $1.5 billion of our outstandi ng common stock as part of our  previously announced Share 
Repurchase Program. The transactions under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025. 
The Inflation Reduction Act imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases. During the 
year ended December 31, 2024, the excise tax on net share repurchases was not material.
