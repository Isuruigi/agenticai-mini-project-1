riod, we eval uate our available-fo r-sale debt securiti es at the individu al 
security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances 
where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to  sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis , the 
difference between fair value and amortize d cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a 
corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition ex ists, we then evaluate wh ether 
a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to  
86 
which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, change s in the credit quality of the unde rlying loan obligors, credit r atings 
actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the p resent value 
of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the secu rity’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. 
A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for 
credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).
