In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) ope ned an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent 
contractors or employees for purposes of  determining whether unemployment insura nce regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. 
The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through 
November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJD OL 
has provided several assessments from February through October 2021.  We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount  
of the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.  
The NJ DOL has initiated an audit for th e period of 2019 through the second quarter  of 2023. The ultimate resolution of the 
matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is record ed within accrued and othe r current liab ilities on the 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
