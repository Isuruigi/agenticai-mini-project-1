Payments and Financial Services 
Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that gove rn payment and financial services activities. For example, our 
subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V ., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain 
payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) . We hold similar licenses in the United Kingdom and Mexico. 
Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions  may determine that certain aspects of our  business are subject to these laws and  could 
require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and  online 
payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our  ability to provide payment processing on our platform or to of fer or 
promote certain financial services to users of the platform.
