long-term strategies . If our operating metrics or our es timates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-o wned 
entities are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates o f our 
category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned entities to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to

In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises regulator y, 
operational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulator y 
actions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences. 
In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as  well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the  
Middle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Dr ivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (in cluding 
our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries) . In 2024, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our  global 
Gross Bookings.
