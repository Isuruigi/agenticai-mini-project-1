when estimating variable consideration. 
Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid  in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as  
customer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated 
statements of operations. We expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be 
one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesse r of the amount of the incentive pa id or the established fair v alue of 
the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to 
customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were immaterial. 
In some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these 
transactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.
