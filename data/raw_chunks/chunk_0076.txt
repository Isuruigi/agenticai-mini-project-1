m or that our commercial partnerships could expire or that our autonomous 
vehicle partners could experience organizati onal failures of their own or otherwise remove their vehicles from our platform. In  the 
event that our competitors bring autonomous ve hicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform,  
deploy their autonomous vehicles on rideshari ng, delivery or logistics platforms other than ours, or their technology is or is perceived 
to be superior to the technology of parties with which we partne r to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be abl e to 
leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our  financial performance and our 
prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substa ntially reduce the cost of providi ng ridesharing, delivery, or logistics 
services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at  a substantially lower price as compared to the price availabl e to 
consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ of ferings over ours,  our financi al 
performance and prospects would be adversely impacted. 
Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and lia bilities. Collisions, including fatal collis ions, have happene d.
