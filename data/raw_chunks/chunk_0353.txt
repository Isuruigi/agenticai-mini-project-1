Foodpanda Taiwan 
In May 2024, we entered into a definitiv e agreement with Delivery He ro SE (“Delivery Hero”) to acquire 100% ownership 
interest in Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda delivery business in Taiwan (“Foodpanda Taiwan”) for approximately $950 million in cash, on 
a cash and debt free basis, subject to certain adjustments. In January 2025, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission issued a decision  
prohibiting the transaction. If we do not appeal the Taiwan Fair  Trade Commission’s decision, we expect to pay a termination fe e 
during the first half of 2025. We expect the termination fee to be  settled in either (i) cash or (ii) by returning our initial investment in 
ordinary shares of Delivery Hero (which Delivery Hero has the option to accept, or alternatively request equivalent cash), and,  as of 
December 31, 2024, we recorded an expense of $236 million in ot her income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of 
operations. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further details on the Delivery Hero investment.
