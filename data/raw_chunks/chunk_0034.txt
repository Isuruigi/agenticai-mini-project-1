rove access to protections and benefits for independent 
workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the 
social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app ba sed companies—to provide benefi ts and protections to their 
users without compromising the flex ibility of their use of the app.  Some examples of our advocacy  to preserve flexibility of 
work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows: 
◦ In Washington State, we partnered with industry and labor to support a bill regulati ng rideshare, including minimum 
earnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers’ compensation coverage for drivers. 
◦ In New York and Massachusetts, we reached agreements wi th the Attorneys General that introduce new protections 
for rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits. 
◦ In France, we reached a number of sectoral bargaining agreements with elected workers’ representatives to 
implement new standards related to minimum guaranteed reve nues for couriers, minimum fare per trip for drivers, 
and deactivation transparency and appeals process for both. 
• Protections and benefits : We partner with leading insurance companie s around the world to pioneer protections for 
independent workers.
