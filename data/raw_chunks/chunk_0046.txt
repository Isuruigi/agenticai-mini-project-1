Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions 
regarding independent contractor classification, could require cl assification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-empl oyees 
where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became 
effective as of January 1, 2020. Governme nt authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 
requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. 
In November 2020, California vot ers approved Proposition 22, a Ca lifornia state ballot  initiative that provi des a framework for  
drivers that use platforms like ours for inde pendent work. Proposition 22 we nt into effect in Decembe r 2020 and we expect that 
Drivers will be able to maintain their st atus as independent contract ors under California law and th at we and our competitors w ill be 
required to comply with the pr ovisions of Proposition 22.
