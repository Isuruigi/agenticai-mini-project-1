the markets in which we 
operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our pl atform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible tha t such 
mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dr ivers use, 
do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to  be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the m ost 
current version of such software, we may be required to seek comp arable software from other sources, which may be more expensiv e 
or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business. 
Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform  across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that 
we do not control. 
One of the most important features of our platform is its br oad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, an d 
third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from th e web and from devices running various operating systems such as iO S and  
29 
Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not 
control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly  evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure 
its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes.
