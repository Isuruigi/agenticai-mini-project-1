olidat ed financial statements in c onformity with GAAP requires mana gement to make estimates and 
assumptions, which affect the reported amount s in the financial statements and accomp anying notes. Estimates are based on histo rical 
experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which manage ment believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an 
ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not  limited to: fair values of investments and other financial 
instruments (including the measurement of cr edit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair val ue of 
acquired intangible assets and related impairment as sessments; impairment of goodwill; stock- based compensation; income taxes a nd 
non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets a nd tax liabilities; insura nce reserves; and other contingent liabilities.  These 
estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.
