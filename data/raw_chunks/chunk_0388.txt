We account for stock-based comp ensation expense in acco rdance with the fair va lue recognition and meas urement provisions of 
GAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite 
service period. We account for forfeitures when they occur. The fa ir value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is deter mined 
on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if appli cable) at fair value, using a ppropriate valuation techniques. The fair 
value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.
