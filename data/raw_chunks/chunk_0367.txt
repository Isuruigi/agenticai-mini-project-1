ents of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based 
on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impa irment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not 
necessarily be limited to, a significant dete rioration in the earnings performance, cr edit rating, asset quality, or business p
rospects of 
the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environm ent of the investee, a bona fi de offer 
to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed au ction process for the same or si milar securities for an amount less than 
the carrying amount of the investme nts in those securities. If an impairment exis ts, a loss is recognized in the consolidated s tatements 
of operations for the amount by which the ca rrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. We include investments in eq uity 
securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Debt Securities 
Accounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the secu rity, 
and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially record ed at fair 
value. Investments in marketable debt securities may include U. S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate  
bonds, and time deposits.
