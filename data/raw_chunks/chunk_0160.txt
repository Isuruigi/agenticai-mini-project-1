in the future, examine or 
challenge our methodologies for valuing deve loped technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ou r 
financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lo wer 
than anticipated in ju risdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and hi gher than anticipated in ju risdictions that have hi gher 
statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U. S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax law s, 
regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authoritie s, as well 
as foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such rev iews 
and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide 
provision for income taxes and other tax lia bilities requires significant judgment by our mana gement, and we ha ve engaged in ma ny 
transactions for which the ultimate tax de termination remains uncertain. The ultimat e tax outcome may differ from the amounts 
recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such 
determination is made.
