Equity Compensation Plans 
We maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for th e issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and 
other employees, directors, and consultant s: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 
Plan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have 
all been approved by stockholders. Following our IPO in May 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the 
ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 a nd 2013 Plans. These plans provide  for the issuance of incentive 
stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance-based awards, and other 
awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).
