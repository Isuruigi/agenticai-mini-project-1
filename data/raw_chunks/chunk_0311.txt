lue that is credit -related, we 
compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized 
cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and  
recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (los s).

Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in cr edit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and 
corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.
