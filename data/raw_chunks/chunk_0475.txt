e positive evidence as described ab ove 
and anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets 
will be realizable. We continue to maintain  a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not m ore-
likely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. 
Furthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will 
not be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against th ese net deferred tax assets. We regularly  review 
the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected ti ming of 
the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. 
Based on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have 
sufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months.
