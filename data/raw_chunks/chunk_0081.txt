cularly challenging when we 
acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and pl anned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be 
adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to  expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in  an 
efficient manner, or if our operational tec hnology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers,  or 
Carriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected a nd may cause platform users to sw itch to our competitors’ platforms, 
which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
Our organizational structure is complex and w ill continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers,  
Shippers, employees, products and offerings, a nd technologies, and as we continue to ex pand globally. We will need to improve o ur 
operational, financial, and management controls as well as our  reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our 
organizational structure. We will require ca pital and management resource s to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to 
effectively manage the growth of our busine ss, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competit ive 
challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.
