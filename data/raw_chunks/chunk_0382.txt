wi th Shippers that define the price for e ach 
shipment and payment terms and our acceptance of the shipment request from Shippers establishes enforceable rights and obligati ons 
for each contract. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for payment of freigh t charges 
to the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper. We invoi ce the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligatio n to 
facilitate the transportation of the Shi pper’s freight through our network of indepe ndent freight carriers. We recognize revenu e 
associated with our performance obligation over the contract te rm, which represents our performance over the period of time a 
shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contr acts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at 
period end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice. 
Transportation Management 
Our Transportation Management services can include shipment  planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load 
management, freight audit and payment proc essing and other Transportation Management related services. Our sole performance 
obligation in these contracts is the integr ation of these services that allow for th e transport of the Shipper’s freight by ind ependent 
freight carriers.
