aw and reclassify all mobility and delivery earners who make more  than one minimum salary a mont h as employees, with traditional 
labor law rights, including sharing into the profits of the company. 
In addition, reclassification of Drivers as  employees, workers or quasi-employees wher e those statuses exist, have and could le ad 
to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally 
recognized a UK driver union and in 2024, voters in Massachusetts approved a ballot initiative allowing drivers to collectively bargain 
as independent contractors. If a significa nt number of Drivers were to become uni onized and collective bargaining agreement ter ms 
were to deviate significantly from our business model, our busin ess, financial condition, operating results and cash flows coul d be 
materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute invol ving Drivers may harm our reputa tion, disrupt our operations a nd 
reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.
