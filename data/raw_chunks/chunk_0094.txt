jurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local rideshar ing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets ra ther than 
operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has al so included the divestment of certain lines of business in th eir 
entirety, and not just in certain jurisdic tions, and instead partnering and investing in  other companies in those lines of busi ness. As a 
result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, and Aurora. 
Our ownership in these entities involves si gnificant risks that are outside our control. As a result, these companies may make 
decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. 
Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the fu ture. 
While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in  these companies, our business, financial condition, operating r esults, 
and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion.

Any material decline in the business of these entities would adve rsely affect the value of our assets and our financial results . 
Furthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of  these entities, and weakened financial mark ets have 
adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations.
