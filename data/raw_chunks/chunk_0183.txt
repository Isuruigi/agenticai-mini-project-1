mpetition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating 
results. 
Competition authorities closely sc rutinize us under U.S. and fo reign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of 
governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as 
the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India,  particularly surroundi ng issues of pricing parity, earnings parity, price-fixing, and abuse 
of market power. Many of these jurisdictions  also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For 
example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and Germany, alleging that our bus iness 
practices violate applicable an titrust and/or competition laws. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impos e new requirements or 
restrictions on our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or 
restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.
