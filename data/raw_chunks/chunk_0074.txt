ure competi tive 
environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would 
be further damaged and our business may suffer. 
 
If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platfo rm or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before o ur 
competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as 
less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomo us vehicles, our financial perf ormance and prospects would be 
adversely impacted. 
We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous 
vehicle technologies on our platform. For ex ample, in January 2021, we completed th e merger of our au tonomous technologies 
business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to 
which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launc h and commercialization of self-d riving vehicles on our rideshari ng 
network. Additionally, we have en tered into commercial pa rtnerships with various  autonomous mobility and/ or autonomous delivery  
companies. We believe that autonomous vehi cle technologies may ha ve the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we 
compete and that autonomous vehi cles present substantia l opportunities.
