Actual events or results may differ from those expressed in fo rward-looking statements. As such, you should not rely on forward -
looking statements as predictions of future events. We have ba sed the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Repor t on 
Form 10-K primarily on our current expectati ons and projections about future events a nd trends that we believe may affect our 
business, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strate gy, and financial needs. The outcome of the events described  in these 
forward-looking statements is s ubject to risks, uncertainties, a ssumptions, and other factors desc ribed in the section titled “ Risk 
Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. More over, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing 
environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to tim e, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncer tainties 
that could have an impact on the forward- looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results, events a nd 
circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumsta nces 
could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statemen ts reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.
