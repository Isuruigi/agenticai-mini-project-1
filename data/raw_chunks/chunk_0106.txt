personnel and other empl oyees necessary to conduct our business, 
increasing attrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the off ice. Future 
challenges related to our culture and wor kplace practices or additional negative publicity could lead  to further attrition and difficulty 
attracting high-quality employees. 
Future leadership transitions and management changes may cau se uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may 
increase the likelihood of senior management  or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an 
inability to attract, retain, a nd motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our busi ness, 
may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow. 
In addition, we depend on the continued services and performan ce of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer 
Dara Khosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreemen t with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific 
duration. 
Our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior  and key management roles or the failure of key employees to 
successfully transition into new roles, fo r example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attriti on, could 
have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
