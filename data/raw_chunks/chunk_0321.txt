iary, to provide for the potential li abilities for certain risks, including au to liability, uninsured and underinsured mo torist, auto 
physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is an estimate  of our potential liability for  unpaid 
losses and loss adjustment expens es, which represents the estima te of the ultimate unpaid obliga tion for such insurance related  risks 
and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported clai ms and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of th e 
balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted ac tuarial methods applied to his torical 
claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns 
and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severi ty trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are conti nually 
reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments to reserves retained by us, if any,  
relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. 
All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserv es, are subject to inherent 
variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement  process.
