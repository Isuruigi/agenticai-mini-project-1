primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. gove rnment and agency securities, a nd investment-grade corporate d ebt 
securities. Our investment policy limits th e amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.  Cash 
deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of hig h credit 
quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. We rely on t hird 
parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment ser vice 
providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% 
or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
