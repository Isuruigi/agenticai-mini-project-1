n current litigation or simila r actions that may be brought in the future, we may be require d to treat 
Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If,  as a result of legislation o r judicial 
decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we  would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, 
including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage , overtime, and meal and rest 
period requirements), employee bene fits, social security contributions, taxes (dir ect and indirect), and potential penalties. I n this case, 
we anticipate significant price increases fo r Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial i mpact to 
Uber would be moderated by th e likelihood of other indus try participants being similarly affected. Add itionally, we may not hav e 
adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we m ay 
not be able to hire a majority of the Dr ivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us  to 
fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financ ial 
position and cash flows.
