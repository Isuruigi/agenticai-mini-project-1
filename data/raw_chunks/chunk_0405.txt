We review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously 
recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes t o our 
disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated infor mation. 
Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. 
The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax exam inations and investig ations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of  
these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial  
condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any su ch outcome becomes probable and estimable, could 
be materially adversely affected. 
We recognize estimated loss es from contingencies that relate  to proceedings in wh ich Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings  
and regulatory penalties against Drivers for which we elect to eith er pay on behalf of or reimbur se Drivers, as a reduction of revenue 
in the consolidated statements of operations. All other esti mated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and 
administrative expenses. 
Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.
