Monthly Active Platform Consumers.  MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a 
Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer  can 
use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs 
to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transact ions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries  in which 
we operate.
