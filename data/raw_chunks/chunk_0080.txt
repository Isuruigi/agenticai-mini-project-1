. Properly managing our g rowth 
or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could 
likewise harm our business. 
Our failure to upgrade our technology or netw ork infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated  
system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To mana ge 
the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the tec hnology that supports our business ope rations, as well as our fin ancial 
and management systems, disclosu re controls and procedur es, and internal controls  over financial reporti ng, we will be required  to 
commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction proc essing 
and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with 
respect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designi ng 
controls in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we 
acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and pl anned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be 
adequate to support our future operations.
