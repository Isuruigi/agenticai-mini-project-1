Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial 
services. 
Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain 
jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licen ses to 
continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subs idiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V ., is registered an d 
authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as  an electronic money institution.  This authorization permits Ub er 
Payments B.V . to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as 
referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/ EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addi tion, 
Uber Payments B.V . has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other 
countries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a si milar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduc t 
Authority, as does UBR Pagos México, S.A.
