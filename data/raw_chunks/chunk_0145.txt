ces through which we  distribute our platform will 
maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fe es to list our applications for download. For example, 
Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If i OS users do 
not grant us such permission, our ability to  target those users for advertisements a nd to measure the effectiveness of such 
advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire 
and engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third par ties to provide software for our products and offerings, includ ing 
Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the func tionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternati ve 
mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we 
operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our pl atform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible tha t such 
mapping functions may not be reliable.
