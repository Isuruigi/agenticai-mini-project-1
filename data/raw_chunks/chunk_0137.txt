business, end-users’ behaviors, business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be  adversely impacted as a result of the adverse 
impact our business partners and third-part y vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic cau sed 
extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, an d any 
future pandemics or other catast rophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of conflicts in the 
Middle East and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which ma y include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regio nal 
instability, and geopolitical shifts, increase d tensions between the Unite d States and countries in which we operate, and the e xtent of 
the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect our business or th e value of 
our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition, operating re sults, or the trading price of  our 
common stock. The failure of a bank, or ot her adverse conditions impacting financial in stitutions at which we maintain balances , 
could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance.
