Competitive Environment 
We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face  significant competition in each  of the mobility and delivery  
industries globally and in the logistics i ndustry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost  
alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that cha racterize 
these industries. As we and our competito rs introduce new products and offerings, and as ex isting products  evolve, we expect to  
become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally a nd introduce new products and offerings across a range 
of industries, many of  our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing 
them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in eac h of 
our offerings includes:

• Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle owne rship and usage, which acc ounts for the majority of 
passenger miles in the markets that we se rve, and traditional transportation servic es, including taxicab companies and taxi-
hailing services, livery and other car services.
