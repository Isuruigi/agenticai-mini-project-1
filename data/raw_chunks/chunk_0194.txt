investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resul ting in 
exposure to material civil or cr iminal liability. Ou r data security and privacy  practices have been th e subject of inquiries fr om 
government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree  
pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program , undergo biennial third-party 
assessments, and not misrepresent how we protect consumer info rmation through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final  
settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activ ities, future failure to report security incidents. In Novemb er and 
December 2018, UK, Dutch and French superv isory authorities imposed fi nes totaling approxi mately $1.6 million. We have also 
entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a 
settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney Gene ral under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices.  In 
addition, in September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments  with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S.
