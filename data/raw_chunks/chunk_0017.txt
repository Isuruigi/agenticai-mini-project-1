Operational Excellence 
 
Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use thei r extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly 
launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and 
build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. 
Product Expertise 
 
Our products are built with the expertise that allows  us to set the standard for powering movement on-
demand, provide platform users with a contextual, in tuitive interface, continua lly evolve features and 
functionality, and deliver safety and trust. 
We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings th at we believe will further stre ngthen our platform and existing 
offerings. 
We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen 
engagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network sc ale and liquidity, which further increases t he 
value of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended  
December 31, 2024, approximately 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform.
