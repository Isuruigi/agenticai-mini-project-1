Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB ”) issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 
Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions 
are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities  and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subje
ct to 
contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for pub lic companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 202 3. We 
adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024. The add itional required disclosures did not have a material impa ct on our consolidated financial 
statements. 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment  Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment 
Disclosures,” which adds required disclosures of significant expenses for each reportable segment, as well as certain other dis closures 
to help investors understand how the chief operating decision make r (“CODM”) evaluates segment expenses and operating results. 
The new standard also allows disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability, if those measures are used to allocate resources 
and assess performance.
