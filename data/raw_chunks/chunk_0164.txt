there is a ri sk that 
our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to  offset future income tax li abilities, which could material ly and 
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Secti ons 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “owne rship 
change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by valu e) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corpor ation’s 
ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operati ng loss carryforwards and other pr e-ownership change U.S. feder al tax 
attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ow nership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow si milar 
rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership ch ange. We may experience ownership changes in the future becaus e of 
subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership chan ge net 
operating loss carryforwards and other tax attr ibutes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitat ions, 
which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
