y exchange rates. 
Because we conduct a significant and may co nduct a growing portion of our business in currencies othe r than the U.S. dollar but  
report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face  exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exch ange 
rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense,  and 
assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materia lly and thus affect our overall financial results. Although we ha ve entered 
into and may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to ma nage foreign currency translati on, such activity may not compl etely 
eliminate fluctuations in our operating resu lts due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risk y, and 
we have limited experien ce establishing hedgi ng programs, which could expos e us to additional risks th at could adversely affect  our 
financial condition and operating results. 
If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrat e suitable businesses, our operati ng results and prospects could  be 
harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
