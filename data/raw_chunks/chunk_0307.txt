identifiable assets and liab ilities is recorded as goodwill. Such  valuations require ma nagement to make si gnificant estimates a nd 
assumptions, especially with re spect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, 
but are not 
limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade 
names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attr ition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar  brand 
licenses, useful lives, and discount rates. 
Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain 
and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifia ble assets 
and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life , whereas 
any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, ar e not amortized. During the measur ement period, which may be up t o one 
year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to th e assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the correspondin g offset 
to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
