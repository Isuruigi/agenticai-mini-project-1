n the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health 
concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adve rse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An 
economic downturn, increased competition, or  regulatory obstacles in any of these ke y metropolitan areas w ould adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and operating results to a much great er degree than would the occurrence of such events in other  areas. 
In addition, any changes to local laws or  regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or  increase 
our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing 
licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inabili ty to 
operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely aff ect our 
business, financial condition, and operating results. 
Further, we expect that we will continue  to face challenges in pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our 
network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.
