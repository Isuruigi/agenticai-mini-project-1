r-sale and are initially record ed at fair 
value. Investments in marketable debt securities may include U. S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate  
bonds, and time deposits. Subsequent changes in fair value of avai lable-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehe nsive 
income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under 
the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.  
As of December 31, 2024, we considered our marketable debt s ecurities as available for use in current operations, including those 
with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated bala nce 
sheets. 
Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities 
We account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt secur ities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit 
Losses (“ASC 326”). Under ASC 326, at each re porting period, we eval uate our available-fo r-sale debt securiti es at the individu al 
security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).
