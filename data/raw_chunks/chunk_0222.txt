available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant ro yalties or 
license fees, which may increase our operating expenses. We ma y also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technolo gy, 
content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot 
license or develop alternative technology, c ontent, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our bu siness, 
we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevente d from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of the se 
results could harm our operating results.  
Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. 
The accounting for our business is complicate d, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based  on 
the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant  accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulati ons, and 
changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations.
