Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several 
reductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organiz ational structure or effectively manage our growth or any futu re 
reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. 
Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the 
complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant st rain on our manageme nt, personnel, operati ons, 
systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal  financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able  to 
manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 31,100 global em ployees, of whom approximately 18,000 were located outside 
the United States. The total number of our employees located outsi de the United States has increased and may continue to increa se as 
we expand globally. Properl y managing our growth will require us  to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and  
staff, including engineers, ope rations personnel, fi nancial and accounting staff,  and sales and marketi ng staff, and to improve  and 
maintain our technology.
