ny failure to protect or any loss of ou r intellectual 
property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating 
results. 
Companies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,” 
seeking to profit from royalties in connec tion with grants of licenses or seeking to  obtain injunctions, own large numbers of p atents, 
copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter in to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other vi olations of 
intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or 
infringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights. 
Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not 
operated, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we  
acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual proper ty 
infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation.
