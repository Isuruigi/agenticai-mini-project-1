he general economy, limit our flex ibility in planning for, or r eacting to, changes in our busine ss and the 
industry, and prevent us from ta king advantage of busines s opportunities as they arise. We ca nnot assure you that our business will 
generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make 
required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash  for 
operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts suffici ent to 
cover our debt service obligations. 
In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations rega rding 
our business and operations, including limitations on incurring add itional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations,

mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of  dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us i n the 
future could involve add itional restrictive covenants relati ng to our capital-raising activitie s and other financial and operat ional 
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue busin ess opportunities, including poten tial 
acquisitions or divestitures.
