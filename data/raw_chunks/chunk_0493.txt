unction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the 
Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the deci sion with the California Supre me 
Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court 
of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22. 
Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers th at use platforms like ours to qualify as 
independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent con tractors 
under California law, and we a nd our competitors are required to comply with the provisions  of Proposition 22.  Proposition 22 w
ent 
into effect on December 16, 2020. 
The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit wa s returned to the trial court  
following the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft fil ed a 
stipulation to dissolve the preliminary in junction with the trial court. On April 16,  2021, the trial court signed an order gra nting the 
stipulation. Although the preliminary inj unction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the Cali fornia 
Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22.
