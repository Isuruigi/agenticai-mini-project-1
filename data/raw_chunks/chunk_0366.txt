type of investment. Our 
marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the 
consolidated statements of operations. Ce rtain investments in non-marketable equity  securities are measured at cost, with 
remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observa ble price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar 
securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess non-marketable equity securities at each reportin g period 
to determine whether they have a readily de terminable fair value,  in which case they would no longer be eligible for the fair v alue 
measurement alternative. Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a 
readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the 
consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based 
on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impa irment indicators.
