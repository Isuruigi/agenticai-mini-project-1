hanges in internal control over financial reporting that  have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materi ally affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis. 
The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with  
45 
Section 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to  complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a 
timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help 
ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and 
testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weakness es in our internal control over financial reporting, 
we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future,  
which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely de signing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal contro l 
over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability  to accurately report our financ ial condition or operating results.
