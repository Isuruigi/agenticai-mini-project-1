may be disrupted. For certain paym ent methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay  
interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers 
are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online paymen t 
providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant part ners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operat ing costs 
will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
In addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timeline s 
and processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfacti on and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Futu re 
failures of the payment processing infrastru cture underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment oper ations 
and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure 
declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason,  the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, an d Carriers 
could be adversely affected.
