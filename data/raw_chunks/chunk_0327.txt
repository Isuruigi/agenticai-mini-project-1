y risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified 
across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions. 
We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/( loss) as a result of transaction gains or 
(losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability bala nces that are denominated in currencies other than the functio nal 
currency of the entities in whic h they are recorded. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to mitigate the foreig n 
exchange risk associated with assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. While these contracts 
help reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, they do not fully eliminate this risk.
