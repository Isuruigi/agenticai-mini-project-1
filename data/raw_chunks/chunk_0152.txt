We use third-party open source software in  connection with the development of our pl atform. From time to time, companies that 
use third-party open source software have fa ced claims challenging the use of such ope n source software and their compliance wi th 
the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject  to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to  be 
open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses req uire 
end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make 
available all or part of such software, which in some circum stances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ 
practices designed to monitor our complia nce with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable 
proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open sourc e 
software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-complianc e with the applicable terms of such license, including claims fo r 
infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract.
