osed ridesharing regulations  in Egypt and other jurisdic tions 
may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, wh ich we may not be willing to pr ovide. 
Our failure to share such data  in accordance with these regulations may resu lt in government authoritie s assessing significant fines or 
penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis. 
In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these 
legal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our bus iness. Others have been brought by taxica b 
owners, local regulators, local law enforcem ent, and platform users, including Driver s and consumers. These include individual,   
35 
multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, 
competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculati ons, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product lia bility, 
discrimination, safety, and employment.
