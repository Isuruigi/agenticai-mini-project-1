may lack sufficient opportunities for Driver s to earn a fare, Carriers to  book a shipment, or mercha nts to provide their goods,  which 
may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient  supply of platform users woul d decrease our network liquidity  and 
adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than some 
competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintain ing 
a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any give n time and our ability to execute operationally may be more 
important to service quality than  the absolute size of the network. If our servi ce quality diminishes or  our competitors’ produ cts 
achieve greater market adopt ion, our competitors may be able to  grow at a quicker rate than we  do and may diminish our network 
effect. 
Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, 
dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, food, and sh ipments (including a reduction in incentives), broader 
economic and labor market dynamics, changes in government policy,  dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the 
Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality  of platform user support, dissatisfac tion with the merchant selection on Deliver y,
