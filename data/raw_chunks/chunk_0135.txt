h certain investors and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia 
campaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h 
activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther 
stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified 
above and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social  related initiatives, whether du e to 
perceived over- or under-pursuit of  such initiatives, may result in  issues hiring or retaining em ployees, as well as potential 
investigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business.
