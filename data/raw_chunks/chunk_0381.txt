services, and fees charged to end-users for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is 
complete. 
In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee pai d by 
Couriers is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid  by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-user s are 
quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Couriers  based on time and distance for the delivery. We typically rece ive the 
service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.

shipment and payment terms and our acceptance of the shipment request from Shippers establishes enforceable rights and obligati ons 
for each contract.
