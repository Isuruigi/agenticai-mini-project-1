-Income Tax Matters 
United Kingdom
 
As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of 
transportation and is required to remit V AT. Uber UK is remitt ing V AT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“V AT 
Order 1987”), which allows for V AT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.  
As of December 31, 2024, we have receive d multiple assessments from the HMRC dispu ting our application of V AT Order 1987 
for the period of March 2022 to June 2024, totaling appr oximately $1.6 billion (£1.3 billion) for unpaid V AT. Uber paid the 
assessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.  
The payments made in 2023 and 2024 are record ed as a receivable in other assets on our  consolidated balance sheet because we 
believe that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our paym ents will be returned to us with interest upon 
completion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additiona l assessments related to this matter and will be required to p ay the 
assessments in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have n o 
impact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defe nd our application of the V AT Order 1987 and are waiting to obta in 
hearing dates from the Tax Tribunal.
