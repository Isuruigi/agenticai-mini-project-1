Trips. We define Trips as the number of comp leted consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, 
an UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers 
represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.

Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility 
rides, Delivery orders (in each case withou t any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, a nd 
Driver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the 
scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.
