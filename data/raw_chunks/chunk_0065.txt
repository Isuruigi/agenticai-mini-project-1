support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, includi ng safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to 
attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish 
or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging us ers to cease use of our platform takes h old, if 
we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we  cannot otherwise attract and retain a la rge number of Drivers, consumers, mer chants, 
Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.
