We are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or 
otherwise, and we may be unable to protec t or provide a safe environment for Driver s and consumers as a result of certain actio ns by 
Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties. Su ch actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of li fe for 
consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reput ational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Althou gh we 
administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background check s on Drivers through third-part y 
service providers in the United States, these qualification pr ocesses and background checks may not expose all potentially rele vant 
information and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service provider s where 
utilized may fail to conduct such background checks ade quately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determinatio n of 
eligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for 
Mobility Drivers.
