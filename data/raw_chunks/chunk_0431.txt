Mission Bay 1 & 2 
We own two adjacent office buildings, Mission Bay 1 & 2, which are located on land for which we have two 76-year land lease 
agreements (“Land Leases”) ending in 2092. We have a 49% indirect  interest in the land (“Indirect Interest”) which are accounted for 
as a financing arrangement due to our 49% previous ownership in the land and continui ng involvement through a purchase option o n 
the land in the Land Leases. As of December 31, 2024, our Indirect Interest is included in property and equipment, net, with th e 
corresponding financing obligation included in other long-term liabilities. The remaining 51% of the Land Leases are accounted for as 
operating leases. The annual rent amounts under the Land Leases are fixed through 2032, after which, the annual rent amounts wi ll 
adjust annually based on the prevailing consumer price index.
