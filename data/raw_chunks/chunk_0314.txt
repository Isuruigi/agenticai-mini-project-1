Loss Contingencies 
We are involved in legal proceedings, cl aims, and regulatory, indirect tax exam inations, or governme nt inquiries and 
investigations that may arise in the ordina ry course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for subst antial or 
indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the 
amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be rea sonably 
estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
We review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously 
recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed.
