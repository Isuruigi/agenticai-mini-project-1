and anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets

likely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. 
Provision for income taxes decreased by $6. 0 billion primarily attributable to the release of $6.4 billion of our valuation 
allowance of certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2024.
