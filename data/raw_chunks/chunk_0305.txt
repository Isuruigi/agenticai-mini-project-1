Revenue Recognition 
We derive our revenue from service fees paid by Drivers and Me rchants for the use of our platform in connection with our 
Mobility products and Delivery of fering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our so le performance ob ligation in the 
transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to  facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or  delivery. 
In many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users a nd charge a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for 
Mobility or Delivery services. 
Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service 
provided to the end-user and are the principa l in the transaction (gross), or we arra nge for other parties to provide the servi ce to the 
end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).
