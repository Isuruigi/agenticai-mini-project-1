Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements have been  prepared in accord ance with generally accepted accounting 
principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which 
we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 1 5 – 
Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheet, and notes th ereto, have been reclassified to conform to the current per iod 
presentation. Certain insurance reserves in accrued and other current liabilities and other l ong-term liabilities were reclassi fied to 
short-term and long-term insurance reserves, respectively. Deferre d tax assets, previously presented within other assets, were 
reclassified to be presented separately on our consolidated balance sheet. These recl assifications had no impact on our previou sly 
reported total assets, total liabilities, results of operations, co mprehensive income or net cash  flows from operating, financi ng or 
investing activities. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of our consolidat ed financial statements in c onformity with GAAP requires mana gement to make estimates and 
assumptions, which affect the reported amount s in the financial statements and accomp anying notes.
