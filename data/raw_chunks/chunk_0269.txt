The Inflation Reduction Act Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”), which is a minimum tax calculated by reference to 
financial statement income, does not apply to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024. We could be subject to the CAMT  
in future years, which would require us to make minimum cash tax payments. 
In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Deve lopment has led international efforts among approximately 140 
countries and taxing jurisdictions to propos e and implement changes to numerous long- standing tax principles, including a frame work 
that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. Under this guidance, we will be required to determine a com bined 
effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under these rules is less than 
15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%.  We are continuing to monitor the pendin g 
implementation of these rules by individual countries and the potential impact on our business. The provision effective in 2024  had an 
insignificant impact on our tax obligations for 2024.
