transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments a nd incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the am ount

End-User Discounts and Promotions 
We offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to 
determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End- user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marke ting 
expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. 
Business Combinations 
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the ta ngible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible asset s 
acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fa ir value of purchase considera tion over the fair values of t hese 
identifiable assets and liab ilities is recorded as goodwill. Such  valuations require ma nagement to make si gnificant estimates a nd 
assumptions, especially with re spect to intangible assets.
