tility of  Uber’s stock price. We estimate the expected term based on various 
exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
We record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equi ty awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated 
attribution method over the requisi te service period, and only if  performance-based conditions are considered probable to be sa tisfied. 
We determine the requisite service period by comparing the deri ved service period to achieve the market-based condition and the  
explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) 
We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering peri od. 
The ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately si x 
months. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price o f 
either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under th e ESPP 
based on a combination of options valued  using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  We determine volatility over an expected 
term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility.
