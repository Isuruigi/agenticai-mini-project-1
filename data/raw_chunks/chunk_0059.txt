The markets in which we compete have attracted significant inve stments from a wide range of f unding sources, and we anticipate 
that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders ha ve made substantia l 
investments in certain of our co mpetitors and may increase such investments, make  new investments in other competitors, or ente r 
into strategic transactions  with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic tr ansactions, along with other compe titive 
advantages discussed above, may allow our compe titors to compete more effe ctively against us and con tinue to lower their prices , 
offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and  
Carriers to their platform and away from our s. Such competitive pres sures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fee s or 
maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer disc ounts and promotions. Ridesharing a nd certain other categories in w hich 
we compete are rela tively nascent, and we cannot  guarantee that they will  stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allo w us to 
maintain profitability.
