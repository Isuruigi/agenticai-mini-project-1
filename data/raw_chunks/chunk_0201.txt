United States, this Framework has been ch allenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from  the 
EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to  transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees  in 
those regions, which could have an advers e effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, and has resulted  in and 
may result in substantial fines, enforcemen t actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may 
impact our business. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, 
including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtai ning or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforce ment
