egal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future 
prospects. 
As of December 31, 2024, our platform is av ailable in more than 15,000 cities in over 70 countries. We are subject to differing , 
and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of 
proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in 
foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and m aterially 
harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we ope rate our business, increasin g our 
operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted. 
Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessar y to 
comply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the gr owth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our 
offerings in new areas, such as  non-emergency medical tran sportation, we may be subject to additional h ealthcare-related federal and 
state laws and regulations.
