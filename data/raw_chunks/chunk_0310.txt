. If an equity i nvestment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new  
carrying value for the investment and rec ognize an impairment loss through our conso lidated statement of operations. Investment s in 
debt securities are evaluated for impairme nt quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. I n 
circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortiz ed cost 
basis, the difference between the fair valu e and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement  of 
operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then 
evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists  can 
include the extent to which fair value is  less than the amor tized cost basis, ch anges in the credit quality of the underlying l oan 
obligor’s, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit -related, we 
compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized 
cost basis of the security.
