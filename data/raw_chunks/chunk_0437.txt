2030 Refinanced Term Loans 
In March 2023, we entered into two refinancing transactions pursu ant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan 
Agreement. On March 3, 2023, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $1.75 billion (“First Closing”), the 
proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2025 Refinanced Term Lo an of $1.4 billion and $317 million of the 
outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. On March 14, 2023, we en tered into the second refinancing transaction under which we 
borrowed $761 million (“Second Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term  
Loan. The Second Closing c onstituted an additional term loan in  the same tranche as the First Closing (collectively, the “2030 
Refinanced Term Loans”). 
The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans had a maturity date of March 3,  2030. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans 
was Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) subject to a floor  of 0.00%, plus 2.75% per annum. The refinancing transactions 
qualified as both a debt modification and debt extinguishment. As a result, we rec ognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguish ment 
during the year ended December 31, 2023 in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.
