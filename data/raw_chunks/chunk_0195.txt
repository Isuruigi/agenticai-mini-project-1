addition, in September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments  with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and th e District 
of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, wh ich involved payment of  $148 million and assurances that  we would enhance our data 
security and privacy prac tices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V . were each fined €2.12 million by 
the Italian data protection aut hority for alleged privacy viola tions stemming from an investig ation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in 
July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 
Breach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other 
penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the 
companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant 
regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security  incident that allowed access to certain personal information  of riders 
and drivers on its platform as of January 14,  2018.
