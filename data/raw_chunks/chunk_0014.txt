allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a 
variety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also 
includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. 
Delivery 
Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, 
alcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We 
refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, 
Uber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, 
which in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own 
costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  
earnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed 
vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -
Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.
