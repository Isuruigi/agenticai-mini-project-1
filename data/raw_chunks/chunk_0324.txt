Investment Risk  
Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits 
typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial in stitutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. 
These deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that 
our deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by th e U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which  we do  
69 
business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other ba nks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or 
liquidity crisis. 
Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and m eet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We
