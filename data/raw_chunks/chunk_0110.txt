policies, may misappropriate confidential, pr oprietary, or personal information held by  or on behalf of us, disrupt our operati ons, 
damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. In add ition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect aga inst 
security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches , including potential liability that may not be limited to the amo unts 
covered by our insurance. 
Security breaches could also expose us to liability under various  laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the ri sk of 
litigation and governmental investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the 
future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a cybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed certain internal corporate 
systems, tools and data. In Oc tober and November of 2016, outside actors downl oaded the personal data of approximately 57 milli on 
Drivers and consumers worldwide  (the “2016 Breach”). The access ed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone  
23 
numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information.
