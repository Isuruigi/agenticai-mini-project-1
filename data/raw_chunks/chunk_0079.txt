and manage qualified employees and  
staff, including engineers, ope rations personnel, fi nancial and accounting staff,  and sales and marketi ng staff, and to improve  and 
maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we ar e unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating  new 
employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Mor eover, 
in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, and may in  
17 
the future implement other reductions in wo rkforce. Any reduction in workforce or re structuring may yield unintended consequenc es 
and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in wo rkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and 
could adversely affect our reputa tion as an employer, which could make it more di fficult for us to hire new employees in the fu ture 
and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our g rowth 
or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could 
likewise harm our business.
