Equity Method Investments 
Investments in common stock or in-substan ce common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant 
influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the 
fair value option is elected. Investments accounted for under th e equity method are initially reco rded at cost. Subsequently, w e 
recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of 
the investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis di fferences. We record our share of the results of equity metho d 
investments one quarter in arrears as income  (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of  
operations. We evaluate each of our equity method invest ments at the end of each reporting pe riod to determine whether events o r 
changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying valu e of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the 
consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to  the investment balance, any required impairment loss.
