previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition,  our existing and future safeguards, including training and comp liance 
programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for whi ch we 
could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including 
the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.
