gs. For example, through our acquisiti on of 
Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering 
to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery 
offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh 
Transplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the 
markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful 
and innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of 
risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior 
development or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities 
(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not 
currently anticipate.
