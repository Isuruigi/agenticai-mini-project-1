ing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended,  or we have been required to change our business model, due 
primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtaine d licenses 
or permits to operate and must continue to  comply with the license or permit requireme nts or risk revocation. In addition, we m ay not 
be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation i n other 
jurisdictions may embolden or enc ourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms 
of an existing license or permit. 
Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdic tions in the United States and abroad continue to lobby legisl ators 
and regulators to block our Mobility  products or to require us to  comply with regulatory, insu rance, record-keeping, licensing,  and 
other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject . For example, in January 2019,  we suspended our Mobility produ cts 
in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations ma ndating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by  
ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only.
