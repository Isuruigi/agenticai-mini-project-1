he following accounting policies involve a hi gh degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to 
understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to 
be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting es timate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are  
uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different esti mates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the 
accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on 
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due  to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimate s, 
actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 
We believe that the following critical accounting policies refl ect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions us ed 
in the preparation of our consolidated fi nancial statements.
