our efforts. While progress has been made, without more aggressive action from 
policymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated. There can be 
no assurances that our goals will be achieve d in the manner we currently intend or at all, and any failure or perceived failure to meet 
regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change goals (or other environmental and social goals) 
on the timeframe we announced, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our cost s and ability to operate, result in litigation, as well 
as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business. 
In addition, our climate goals are also subject to certain as sumptions, estimations, methodologies, and third-party information that 
we believed to be reasonable at the time, but which may subsequently be determined to be erroneous, insufficient, incomplete,  
27 
inaccurate or otherwise misaligned with stakeholder expectations . Any failure or perceived fail ure to satisfy evolving stakehol der 
expectations regarding our climate goals and environmental and social reporting may harm our re putation and impact relationship s 
with certain investors and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and 
governance related matters.
