determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price c hanges

securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the chang es in fair 
value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of ta x. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments  and 
account for investments in debt and equity se curities at fair value with changes repor ted in net income (loss) from continuing 
operations. 
Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significan t unobservable inputs or data in inactive
