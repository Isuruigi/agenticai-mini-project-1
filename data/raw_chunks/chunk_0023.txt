be fore various national, regiona l, and 
local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to 
our business model. 
In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restric tions and other requirements on 
operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United 
States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, 
rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Furt her, certain jurisdictions, incl uding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations b anning 
certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational rest rictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environ ment 
creates significant complexities for our business and operating m odel. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject 
to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. 
Substantially all states in the United States and numerous muni cipalities in the United States and around the world have adopte d 
Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regul ations.
