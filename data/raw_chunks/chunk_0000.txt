On Our Way
2024 ANNUAL REPORTUber’s Mission
We reimagine the way the world moves for the better
We are Uber. The go-getters. The kind of people who are relentless about our  
mission to help people go anywhere and get anything and earn their way. 
Movement is what we power. It’s our lifeblood. It runs through our veins. It’s 
what gets us out of bed each morning. It pushes us to constantly reimagine 
how we can move better. For you. For all the places you want to go. For all the 
things you want to get. For all the ways you want to earn. Across the entire 
world. In real time. At the incredible speed of now.
